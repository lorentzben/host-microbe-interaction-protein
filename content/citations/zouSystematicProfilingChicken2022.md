### Abstract
Background The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health and has placed pressure on the livestock industry to eliminate the use of antibiotic growth promotants (AGPs) as feed additives. To mitigate their removal, efficacious alternatives are required. AGPs are thought to operate through modulating the gut microbiome to limit opportunities for colonization by pathogens, increase nutrient utilization, and reduce inflammation. However, little is known concerning the underlying mechanisms. Previous studies investigating the effects of AGPs on the poultry gut microbiome have largely focused on 16S rDNA surveys based on a single gastrointestinal (GI) site, diet, and/or timepoint, resulting in an inconsistent view of their impact on community composition. Methods In this study, we perform a systematic investigation of both the composition and function of the chicken gut microbiome, in response to AGPs. Birds were raised under two different diets and AGP treatments, and 16S rDNA surveys applied to six GI sites sampled at three key timepoints of the poultry life cycle. Functional investigations were performed through metatranscriptomics analyses and metabolomics. Results Our study reveals a more nuanced view of the impact of AGPs, dependent on age of bird, diet, and intestinal site sampled. Although AGPs have a limited impact on taxonomic abundances, they do appear to redefine influential taxa that may promote the exclusion of other taxa. Microbiome expression profiles further reveal a complex landscape in both the expression and taxonomic representation of multiple pathways including cell wall biogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and several involved in energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Many AGP-induced changes in metabolic enzyme expression likely serve to redirect metabolic flux with the potential to regulate bacterial growth or produce metabolites that impact the host. Conclusions As alternative feed additives are developed to mimic the action of AGPs, our study highlights the need to ensure such alternatives result in functional changes that are consistent with site-, age-, and diet-associated taxa. The genes and pathways identified in this study are therefore expected to drive future studies, applying tools such as community-based metabolic modeling, focusing on the mechanistic impact of different dietary regimes on the microbiome. Consequently, the data generated in this study will be crucial for the development of next-generation feed additives targeting gut health and poultry production., Video Abstract Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-022-01319-7.

"Over the past 70 years, the chicken industry has made remarkable gains in production efficiency largely driven by intensive breeding programs. Augmenting these breeding programs has been the use of sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics (antibiotic growth promotants (AGPs)), added to chicken feed to enhance production efficiency [1]."

"Given their role in modulating the microbiome, much attention has focused on the use of prebiotics and probiotics [13-15].

"Bifidobacterium, and Clostridium dominate. Although stable, these communities vary over the length of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with lactobacilli dominating the upper GI and Clostridiales dominating the lower GI [6, 7, 24, 25]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=2) )

"Together, these studies suggest that AGPs have a limited impact on microbiome structure that may be restricted to specific taxa at specific sites within the GI tract." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=2) )

"Here, we not only perform a comprehensive investigation of the role of diet, age, and AGP treatment on community structure across the chicken GI tract but also additionally apply whole microbiome RNA sequencing (metatranscriptomics), to reveal expressed functions and the taxa responsible [35-37]" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=2) )

"To investigate the role of diet, age, GI site, and AGPs on microbiome structure and function, we raised 60 broilers (Ross 708, Aviagen) under four feeding regimes: corn based, wheat based, corn based with bacitracin methylene disalicylate" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=3) )

"Consistent with commercial feed practices that optimize production, birds were initially fed a starter diet for 10 days post hatch, followed by a grower diet until day 24 and finally fed a finisher diet until day 40 post hatch (Supplemental Table 1)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=3) )

"The colon and ceca samples had the greatest number of OTUs (51.5 and 52 per sample respectively), while the ileum, gizzard, and jejunum had the fewest (19.1, 20.4, and 21.1 per sample respectively). Unlike the jejunum and ileum, which tend to be dominated by members of Lactobacillaceae, duodenal samples contained additional members of the Staphylococcaeae family, together with unidentified members of the Clostridiales order absent from the jejunum or ileum." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=3) )

"These additional taxa help drive the relative increase in diversity associated with the duodenum (Table 1; Supplemental Table 3)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=3) )

"As the GI tract transitions to a more anaerobic environment, we observed the replacement of Lactobacillaceae with Clostridiales as the dominant family in the ceca and colon. Indeed, in general, the taxonomic profiles of the ceca and colon were distinct from other sites, featuring obligate anaerobes from the Clostridia order (e.g., Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae), as well as many OTUs that could only be classified at the level of phylum (Firmicutes), class (Clostridia), or order (Clostridiales), resulting in the significant increase in diversity observed in these two sites (Supplemental Table 3)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=3) )

"Overall, these results are consistent with previous studies that suggest that GI site, diet, and age have a major impact on microbiome structure [16, 19, 25-27, 39, 40]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=3) )

"To further examine the relative influence of GI site, diet, and age on microbiome structure, we performed a weighted UniFrac analysis (Fig. 1D) of all samples. This analysis reveals that site of sampling has the greatest impact on microbiome structure, followed by host age, with diet and AGPs having minimal relative impact." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=3) )

"gizzard and those from the ceca and colon, reflecting the significant physicochemical differences associated with these sites." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=3) )

"For example, day 10 samples from the ceca and colon cluster separately" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=3) )

"from the more mature samples" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=5) )

"Jejunal and ileal samples, particularly those associated with a wheat-based diet, also appear to delineate by age while those from the gizzard and duodenum do not." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=5) )

"To examine the influence of diet and addition of AGPs on community structure, we grouped samples by age and sampling sites and performed PERMANOVA tests (Table  2)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=5) )

"Our analysis reveals that diet had a greater impact on microbiome structure than AGPs," ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=5) )

"with more sites and timepoints exhibiting significant differences in microbiome structure." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=5) )

"Furthermore, while the diet had a significant impact on microbiome structure across all three timepoints for the gizzard and ileum," ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=5) )

"the colon samples were unperturbed regardless of treatment." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=5) )

"the colon samples were unperturbed regardless of treatment." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=5) )

"Revisiting the diversity analyses (Supplemental Table 3) reveals a complex landscape of response to diet and AGPs that varies according to site and age of sampling. For example, under specific diet/AGP treatments, several sites respond with either an increase in diversity at day 24 relative to the other timepoints (e.g., gizzard/wheat and duodenum/wheat) or a decrease in diversity at day 24 relative to the other timepoints (e.g., duodenum/corn + AGPs and ileum/all treatments). Such nuance is otherwise lost when simply relying on changes in the relative abundance of different taxa (Fig. 1C)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=5) )

"Representing one of the most diverse sites in the chicken GI tract, cecal microbiota have been shown to play a critical role in immune response [41]" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=6) )

"and growth performance [42]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=6) )

"42" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=6) )

"Consistent with our previous PERMANOVA analyses on community structure (Table 2), changes in diet had a greater impact on the community than the application of AGPs" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=6) )

"Furthermore, we found that diet and AGPs had a significant interaction effect on eight taxa in the day 40 samples (comprising four Clostridiales; two Enterobacteriaceae, and two uncharacterized Firmicutes) and only a single taxon in the day 24 samples (Corynebacterineae spp.). Given this complex landscape of the effects of age, diet, and AGPs on taxa, we next dissected these relationships by exploring each combination of diet and AGP in isolation." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=6) )

"The consistency in responses across conditions (e.g., higher abundance in corn relative to wheat or AGPs) suggests that AGPs may eliminate dietary-induced specificities associated with these taxa." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=6) )

"This suggests that AGPs increase the sensitivity of the day 24 microbiome to dietary perturbation more than the day 40 microbiome." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=6) )

"It is important to note, however, that these results may be confounded by the lower number of replicates associated with this timepoint for the two corn-based treatments (3 and 4 for the corn and corn + AGPs treatments, respectively)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=6) )

"In summary, at least for day 40 samples, more taxa were affected by diet than by AGPs." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=6) )

"Previous analyses have shown that microbial communities in the chicken ceca may be organized through influential taxa that serve to promote the presence or absence of other taxa [31]. We were therefore interested in examining if AGPs might perturb interactions between taxa resulting in their mutual presence or absence. Due to their greater complexity, we focused our analyses on the day 40 cecal samples." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=8) )

"In addition to revealing interactions between taxa representing their mutual presence or exclusion in each sample type, we also identified interactions that were significantly altered in response to AGP exposure (Fig. 2C)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=8) )

"This gain was largely driven by a group of genera comprising positive correlations between Acinetobacter, Novosphingobium, Stenotrophomonas, Turicibacter, Clostridirum XIVb, Sphingomonas, and Anaerotruncus." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=8) )

"Furthermore, two of these interactions (Sphingomonas and Novosphingobium and Turicibacter and Clostridirum XIVb) were common to both diets, suggesting they represent mutually supporting taxa, which together exert a significant influence on other taxa, such as the exclusion of Clostridium XVIII (associated with 3 of the 6 interactions that were significantly different between control and AGP samples under a corn diet)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=8) )

"To investigate functional changes within the chicken GI tract, we selectively deployed whole microbiome RNASeq (metatranscriptomics) to samples collected from birds at 24 and 40 days of age. We focused on two sites: jejunum (a key site of digestion and absorption) and the ceca (a major site for invasive enteric pathogens, even in apparently healthy birds)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=8) )

"While it is possible that jejunal gut epithelial cells may be more active than those in cecum, we expect that such a difference in host contamination largely reflects differences in the density of bacteria in the two locations [45]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=8) )

"For example, in the cecal samples, relative to metatranscriptomics, 16S surveys reveal an abundance of reads mapping to "Other Clostridiales," "Other Firmicutes," and "Other Bacteria," suggesting taxa assigned to these groups have limited activity." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=9) )

"Erysipelotrichaceae" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=9) )

"As for the 16S surveys, we find the jejunum samples are dominated by reads mapping to Lactobacillaceae transcripts." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=9) )

"Interestingly, taxonomic profiles based on reads mapping rRNA in the metatranscriptomic dataset do not reflect those from either the complete set of metatranscriptomic assignments or those based on 16S surveys." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=9) )

"Conversely, in the metatranscriptomic profiles of the cecal samples, we see an increase in the relative abundance of reads mapping to Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Alphaproteobacteria, and "Other Proteobacteria," taxa that likely mediate highly active roles in the microbiome." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=9) )

"Interestingly, taxonomic profiles based on reads mapping rRNA in the metatranscriptomic dataset do not reflect those from either the complete set of metatranscriptomic assignments or those based on 16S surveys. This highlights taxonomic biases in the rRNA depletion kit used during preparation of the metatranscriptomic libraries and emphasizes why rRNA datasets derived from these libraries cannot be used to provide useful taxonomic readouts." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=9) )

"Principal component analysis based on gene expression of the cecal samples reveal the first two components are able to separate samples on the basis of diet and, at least for wheat samples, day of sampling (Fig. 4B)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=10) )

"Interestingly, we identified only 30 transcripts in the day 40 samples (and none in the day 24 samples) as being subject to diet by antibiotic interactions." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=10) )

"This may reflect both the relatively low number of samples used in this study and the large number of microbial genes identified, which together limit our ability to identify genes subject to diet by AGP interactions." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=10) )

"Although most of these genes were unique to a specific pairwise comparison, we identified core sets of 202 and 469 microbial transcripts that exhibited significant differential expression across all AGP and dietary comparisons respectively (Supplemental Table 8)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=11) )

"For the core set of dietary comparisons, we identified several pathways involved in nucleotide metabolism (purine and pyrimidine metabolism), amino acid biosynthesis (alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis) and the production of energy (glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis). This likely reflects transcriptional responses to different nutrient environments." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=11) )

"For example, five pathways (phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, galactose metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and thiamine metabolism) exhibited significant changes in pathway expression across all comparisons with the exception of day 40 wheat-based samples" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=11) )

"These and other pathways restricted to specific comparisons are likely related to changes in other feed ingredients associated with the grower and finisher diets; relative to the finisher diets, the grower diets contain a higher percentage of soybean meal at the expense of corn/wheat, canola meal, and vegetable fat (Supplemental Table 1)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=11) )

"This diet-sensitive pattern suggests that AGPs may interfere with regular pathways microbiota rely on for energy production." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=11) )

"For example, four pathways (galactose metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, starch and sucrose metabolism, and thiamine metabolism)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=11) )

"For both cecal and jejunum samples, these pathways were also among those exhibiting the highest levels of expression (Supplemental Fig. 5). Conversely, pathways involved in amino acid metabolism, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and co-factor and vitamin metabolism exhibited the lowest levels of expression." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=13) )

"Comparing the" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=13) )

"samples collected at 24 days (Fig. 6" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=13) )

"Lactobacillaceae dominate enzyme expression in glycolysis under a corn-based diet, while Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae dominate under a wheat-based diet." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=13) )

"At the same time, it is interesting to note the dominance of the Lactobacillaceae in the corn diet, despite both diets exhibiting similar relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=13) )

"Comparisons of enzyme expression between pathways reveal relatively high levels of expression in glycolysis compared to the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle, across all treatments." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=13) )

"these findings nonetheless suggest that glycolysis is a major route for energy productio" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=13) )

"Examples include phosphoglycerate mutase (GpmA, EC 5.4.2.11), which appears upregulated in the presence of AGPs, while glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Pgl, EC 5.3.1.9), phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gnd, EC 1.1.1.44), and ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (Rpe, EC 5.1.3.1), members of the pentose phosphate pathway, are also consistently upregulated in the presence of AGPs." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=13) )

"The downregulation of components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (AceE, AceF, and Lpd), responsible for the production of acetyl-CoA, in the presence of AGPs in day 40 samples, as well as the corn sample from day 24, suggests a potential shift in the flux of metabolites feeding into the TCA cycle." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=13) )

"Notably, the latter lacks representation by Lactobacillaceae in corn-based samples. Given broad representation of Lactobacillaceae across glycolysis in these samples, we suggest that transcripts assigned to the enzyme that are classified as "Other Bacilli" lack resolution to be classified at the higher taxonomic level of Lactobacillaceae. In summary, these investigations reveal AGPs have a dramatic impact on the expression of enzymes in core energy production pathways, with samples from day 24 exhibiting an overall increase in expression. That similar changes were not observed in the day 40 samples may reflect differences in response to the grower and finisher diets used prior to collection of these samples." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=15) )

"Given the enrichment of significantly differentially expressed enzymes in the purine pathway and its previous association with antibiotic usage, we next examined gene expression in the context of the complementary, de novo biosynthetic and salvage pathways" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=15) )

"We observed fewer taxonomic perturbations associated with the de novo pathway expression profiles, with similar taxonomic contributions for multiple genes. Intriguingly, the expression of some enzymes was dominated by a single taxon. Most notably, across all samples, Lactobacillaceae dominate expression of deoxyguanosine kinase (Dgk, EC 2.7.1.113), while other enzymes exhibit such taxon domination only under specific conditions (e.g., adenylate kinase — Adk: EC 2.7.4.3— represented by Erysipelotrichaceae in day 24 Corn and 5'-nucleotidase — SurE: EC 3.1.3.5 — represented by Oscillospiraceae in day 24 wheat + AGPs." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=15) )

"In an attempt to shed light on the downstream consequences of changes in metabolic pathway expression, we applied targeted metabolomics to serum samples collected from all 60 birds used in the study. The resultant profiles capture 139 metabolites, covering a variety of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=15) )

"However, principal component analysis (PCA) found that in the absence of AGPs, these profiles segregated according to age of bird (Supplemental Fig. 9). This suggests that the birds exhibit age-related changes in their metabolism, potentially due, at least in part, to the various diets used in the poultry life cycle. Interestingly, this age effect is lost in birds fed AGPs" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=15) )

"To investigate this effect further, we identified metabolites correlating with age in both control and AGP-treated samples. Consistent with the PCA, 55 and 27 metabolites were found to correlate with age in control and AGP-treated samples respectively (Supplemental Table 12)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=15) )

"Despite possessing many of the enzymes associated with the urea cycle, this pathway is considered nonfunctional in chickens, potentially due" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=15) )

"to the lack of N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), and may therefore provide some alternative function [52]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=16) )

"52]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=16) )

"As NAGS converts glutamate to N-acetyl glutamate, its absence in the chicken genome may in part explain the age-associated increase in glutamate that appears contrary to other metabolites in this pathway." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=16) )

"Focusing on cecal samples from 40-day-old chickens, we observed a similar pattern of increased expression of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis with AGPs (Supplemental Fig. 10). As for the 24-day samples, various clades of proteobacteria appear to be associated with increases in the expression of several genes including homologs of murF, yjjK, ftsZ, and ftsK. However, for the samples obtained from the wheat diet, the addition of AGPs did not reveal a consistent pattern of response. For example, while the expression of secA homologs increased due to greater representation by Lactobacillaceae, the expression of homologs of mrcA, ftsI, and ftsK exhibited decreased expression, particularly for Lactobacillaceae." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=18) )

"Together, these findings suggest that the greater influence of AGPs on the cecal microbiome may reflect its slower passage rate relative to the other GI sites [26] resulting in a longer exposure to the effects of AGPs." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=18) )

"Across all cecal samples, we predict 179 transcripts associated with five categories of resistance mechanism: antibiotic efflux, antibiotic target protection, antibiotic inactivation, antibiotic target alteration, and reduced permeability to antibiotic (Supplemental Table 13)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=18) )

"Together, these findings reveal AGPs to exert effects on additional microbial pathways beyond metabolism, with the potential to directly impact cell growth and division." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=18) )

"In this study, we performed a systematic survey of microbial communities in the gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon in broilers raised on two different diets in the presence and absence of AGPs" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=18) )

"Previous poultry microbiome studies have largely focused on the ceca, due to its role in host health and high species richness [16, 40, 55-57]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=18) )

"Other intestinal sites have typically been neglected with only a limited number of studies utilizing material from feces [17, 58, 59] or the small intestine [25, 60, 61]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=18) )

"Furthermore, where studies have attempted more systematic comparisons, they have either focused on longitudinal sampling over one or two sites [17, 19] or sampling several intestinal sites at a single timepoint [25]. We also note that few studies have investigated the influence of AGPs in the context of wheat-based diets. Consequently, through sampling six sites over three timepoints, this study represents the first attempt to systematically perform a deep taxonomic and functional analysis of the dynamics of the chicken gut microbiome."

"Our findings are in broad agreement with previous studies with a dominance of lactobacilli in the upper GI, being replaced with obligate anaerobes, largely from the phylum, Firmicutes, in the lower GI. These latter taxa include Lachnospiraceae and other clostridia, which are associated with the processing of more complex carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that helps maintain gut health [45]. Interestingly, unlike several previous studies [25, 62, 63], members of the Bacteroidetes were not found to dominate the lower GI. However, while the emergence of Bacteroidetes is often associated with a more mature microbiome [16, 17], we note other studies also report the relatively low abundance of Bacteroidetes in older birds [40, 57]."

"16," ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=18) )

"For example, in ileal samples, we found an initial high abundance of Lactobacillaceae subsequently replaced by members of the Peptostreptococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae at later timepoints [19]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=19) )

"This highlights an important finding, namely that" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=19) )

"while microbial diversity in cecal datasets increased with age consistent with previous studies [7, 39, 56, 64], this was not the case for all sites and treatments (Supplemental Table 3)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=19) )

"Thus, by focusing only on the cecal microbiome, treatments predicted to be beneficial to gut health may ignore potential adverse effects that occur at another GI site." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=19) )

"Supporting this idea is the finding that co-occurrence networks were reorganized in the presence of AGPs, with the disruption of interactions involving several influential taxa." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"This disruption is consistent with a previous study of cow rumen microbiomes, in which antibiotics decreased the number of interactions and connectivity of their co-occurrence networks [65]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"65" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"These nuanced interactions between diet and AGP interaction may in part explain inconsistencies between studies that suggest either AGPs impact community structure (e.g., [18, 33, 66, 67]) or have only a minimal impact (e.g., [60, 64, 68])." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"Beyond community composition, it is important to investigate how AGPs might alter the function of the gut microbiome. To date, functional studies of the poultry gut microbiome have been limited to the application of metagenomics (whole microbiome shotgun DNA sequencing)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"Focusing on antimicrobial resistance genes, such studies reveal AGPs to have minimal impact on the abundance of such genes [69, 70]. However, in previous work, we used metatranscriptomics (whole microbiome RNASeq) to show that similar microbial communities in the mouse gut can exhibit dramatic differences in gene expression in different host genotypes [38]. Similarly, here we found that AGPs have a dramatic impact on the expression of microbial genes including many involved in metabolic pathways, cell wall biogenesis, and antimicrobial resistance." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"Relative to cecal samples, we found that the jejunum samples contained more reads of host and diet origin, suggesting a lower density of bacteria. Encouragingly, taxonomic profiles were similar between the 16S RNA survey samples and the metatranscriptomic samples," ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"albeit with certain taxa exhibiting different levels of activity, suggesting our pipelines are relatively robust in terms of taxonomic assignment." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"Among the pathways altered by AGPs were those responsible for the production of energy and nucleotides. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown the following: (1) the murine gut microbiome alters metabolic pathway expression in the presence with antibiotics, with the effects driven by dietary components such as glucose and polysaccharides [49], and (2) bacteria respond to the stress of antibiotics through the diversion of ATP from core metabolic processes to drive the maintenance of ion gradients [48]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"For example, many changes in glycolytic enzyme expression in the cecal microbiome of 24-day old birds are associated with Lactobacillaceae with a corn-diet and Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae with a wheat-based diet. These findings raise an important consideration: to what extent are these changes in enzyme expression driven simply by changes in taxon abundance. We therefore compared fold-change differences in taxon abundance and global taxon expression with pathway-specific expression for individual taxa" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"Focusing on three pathways discussed above (glycolysis, purine metabolism, and cell wall biogenesis), we found that pathway-specific expression for most taxa deviates by at least twofold from either changes in their abundance or global taxon gene expression (Supplemental Fig. 12)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"As a consequence, investigations focused on the metabolic contributions of individual taxa within a community remain challenging" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"Beyond the abrogation of the age-associated decrease in four metabolites associated with the urea cycle, we did not identify significant differences between AGP" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20) )

"treatment and any of the metabolites measured in host serum." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=21) )

"While it might be expected that host metabolite concentrations might correlate with the observed changes in expression of metabolic enzymes encoded by the microbiome, we note that our analysis only captured a limited number (139) of metabolites investigated." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=21) )

"In addition to metabolic interactions, which are reliant only on metabolites shared by enzymes and are therefore largely taxon agnostic, our ability to interpret metatranscriptomic data in the context of other bacterial systems is limited by the lack of appropriate resources." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=21) )

"this analysis is unable to capture interactions representing taxon-specific innovation" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=21) )

"To illustrate these issues, we constructed species-specific networks for the three most abundant taxa represented within the 24-day ceca samples from corn-fed birds (Lactobacillus reuteri, Ruminococcaceae bacterium, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium), using the STRING protein interaction database [75]. While we identified a core of conserved interactions involving homologs of genes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, ftsZ, secA, and secE, each species lacked detectable homologs for many other genes (Supplemental Fig. 13). Furthermore, we note that many interactions are not conserved for each of the three taxa while also identifying additional interactions not captured by the E. coli-based network. This highlights the need for more taxon-agnostic scaffolds, providing generic representations of bacterial systems, while at the same time, capable of presenting taxon-specific innovations." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=21) )

"if the upregulation of glycolysis in Lactobacillaceae provides a beneficial effect for birds fed a corn diet, the same effects may require upregulation of glycolysis in Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae in birds fed a wheat diet."
