“Plasma amino acid pool ↔ Intracellular amino acid pool ↔ Intracellular proteins” (Scanes, 2021, p. 455) 

“essential amino acids in avian diets for protein production are as follows: Arginine, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine (with a higher requirement if cysteine is not present), threonine, tryptophan, and valine.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 455) 

“Other important amino acids for protein production are the following: Alanine, aspartate, asparagine, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, leucine, proline, phenylalanine, serine, and tyrosine.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 455) 

“Lysine and methionine are the first limiting amino acids for growth (Bornstein and Lipstein, 1975).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 455) 

“20.2 DIGESTION OF PROTEINS Proteins are digested in the gastrointestinal tract to amino acids and dipeptides together with tripeptides. The predominant site for protein digestion is the small intestine. The amino acids and peptides are absorbed in the small intestine.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 456)  ^fdb5b3

“Mechanical grinding by the gizzard l Chemical denaturation by the low pH l Enzymatic proteolysis by pepsin” (Scanes, 2021, p. 456) 

<a id="^d0c6ae"></a> “zymogen” (Scanes, 2021, p. 456)  ^d0c6ae

<a id="^00c634"></a> “The predominant site of protein digestion is the small intestine (Table 20.3). The digested protein (amino acids and dipeptides together with tripeptides) is absorbed in the small intestine (Table 20.3).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)  ^00c634

“Proteins undergo enzymatic digestion in the small intestine by the enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin. These are produced by the pancreas as inactive zymogens (respectively, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen) and transported to the small intestine in the pancreatic secretions. In the small intestine, both trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen are activated by proteolytic cleavage: l Trypsinogen → trypsin l Chymotrypsinogen → chymotrypsin” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) 

“Six members of the trypsinogen gene family have been characterized in the chicken (Wang et al., 1995),” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) 

“These are expressed in the pancreas along with the liver, spleen, and thymus (Wang et al., 1995).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) 

“This proteolytic cleavage results in the formation of an active protease, trypsin.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)

“greater absorption of methionine in the ileum than in other regions of the small intestine” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) 

<a id="^678fb9"></a> “Methionine is absorbed at the highest rate, followed by isoleucine, valine, and leucine, and glutamate is absorbed at the lowest rate, followed by aspartate, glycine, and arginine (Tasaki and Takahashi, 1966; Riley et al., 1986)” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)  ^678fb9

“Tasaki and Takahashi, 1966; Riley et al., 1986” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) 

<a id="^a6039f"></a> “There are series of amino acid transporters (10 in chickens) expressed in the enterocytes of the small intestine, with predominantly increases progressing down the small intestine from the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (chickens: Gilbert et al., 2007).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)  ^a6039f

“Gilbert et al., 2007” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) 

<a id="^a9190f"></a> “Moreover, there are increases in the expression of many amino acid transporters during the period of growth and development post hatching (chickens: Gilbert et al., 2007).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)  ^a9190f

“Not only are proteins in the ingesta digested with the resultant amino acids and small peptides absorbed, but also mucosal intestinal cells are sloughed off and then digested.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) 

“Hurwitz et al. (1972).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) 

<a id="^d1af9a"></a> “There is little information on the roles of the colon and ceca in protein and amino acid digestion and absorption.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 458) Big question  ^d1af9a

“While most of the proteins in the ingesta are digested by the time the ingesta reaches the colon” (Scanes, 2021, p. 458) 

<a id="^4f029b"></a> “the fate of sloughed-off mucosa cells is not known.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 458)  ^4f029b

“There are populations of proteolytic bacteria in the colon of birds (chicken: King et al., 2009).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 458)

“Whole-body net protein synthesis can be estimated by nitrogen balance. F nce, Kino and Okumura (1987) estimated nitrogen balance in 14–21 day old chickens as 0.29 g/day.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 458) 

“Kino and Okumura (1987)” (Scanes, 2021, p. 458) 

<a id="^3288a2"></a>  “It is also possible to experimentally determine whole-body protein net synthesis (accretion) or net degradation, and whole-body protein synthesis, using infusion of a radioactive form of a nonmetabolized amino acid such as phenyl alanine or tyrosine (see Table 20.4). As might be expected, net protein synthesis or accretion is negative in starved chicks or chicks on a diet deficient in specific amino acids (Table 20.5).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 458)  ^3288a2

“Similarly, gastrointestinal protein synthesis is disproportionately high compared to in other tissue.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 461) 

“For instance, in the young chick, 18.9% of protein synthesis occurs in the small intestine plus the pancreas and ceca (calculated from Muramatsu et al., 1987a” (Scanes, 2021, p. 461) 

“Muramatsu et al., 1987a” (Scanes, 2021, p. 461) 

“Diet can influence the protein metabolism of the liver and intestine.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 461) 

“Moreover, there are decreases in both the weights of the liver and small intestine and the rates of protein synthesis in these organs in chickens fed a germ-free diet” (Scanes, 2021, p. 461) 

“Muramatsu et al., 1987a, 1988” (Scanes, 2021, p. 462) 

“This would suggest that microorganisms are stimulating gastrointestinal growth.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 462) 

“Most urinary nitrogenous waste in birds is in the form of uric acid.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 463) 

“The major nitrogenous waste in birds is uric acid (Milroy, 1903). Infusion of ammonia or glutamine increases circulating concentrations of uric acid in chickens (Karasawa and Tasaki, 1973). The enzymes of the uric acid cycle are found in both the liver and kidney.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 464) 

“McFarland and Coon, 1980, 1984” (Scanes, 2021, p. 464) 

<a id="^211adc"></a> “Glutamine is critically important for uric acid formation (see the Section 20.4.2.3). It is not surprising that glutaminase (catalyzing glutamine to glutamate) is either not present or at very low levels in the avian liver (chicken: Wu et al., 1998).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 464)  ^211adc

<a id="^e3b9bb"></a> “The predominant organ responsible for uric acid formation is the liver” (Scanes, 2021, p. 464)  ^e3b9bb

“The existence of a urea cycle in birds has been questioned (Stevens, 1996). However, birds have both uric acid and urates as well as urea in the plasma (see Chapter 11).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 464)  ^3cb9ba

“Stevens, 199” (Scanes, 2021, p. 464) 

“The primary ammonia-detoxifying enzyme in the avian liver is glutamine synthase.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 464)  ^1a1e14

“chicken: Satoh and Matsuno, 1983; Patejunas and Young, 1987).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 464) 

“In contrast to the situation in mammals, there is little zonation of the enzyme in the avian liver” (Scanes, 2021, p. 464)
