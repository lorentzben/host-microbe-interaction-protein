### Abstract
Considerable debate has taken place over the safety and validity of increased protein intakes for both weight control and muscle synthesis. The advice to consume diets high in protein by some health professionals, media and popular diet books is given despite a lack of scientific data on the safety of increasing protein consumption. The key issues are the rate at which the gastrointestinal tract can absorb amino acids from dietary proteins (1.3 to 10 g/h) and the liver's capacity to deaminate proteins and produce urea for excretion of excess nitrogen. The accepted level of protein requirement of 0.8g ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1 is based on structural requirements and ignores the use of protein for energy metabolism. High protein diets on the other hand advocate excessive levels of protein intake on the order of 200 to 400 g/d, which can equate to levels of approximately 5 g ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1, which may exceed the liver's capacity to convert excess nitrogen to urea. Dangers of excessive protein, defined as when protein constitutes > 35% of total energy intake, include hyperaminoacidemia, hyperammonemia, hyperinsulinemia nausea, diarrhea, and even death (the “rabbit starvation syndrome”). The three different measures of defining protein intake, which should be viewed together are: absolute intake (g/d), intake related to body weight (g ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1) and intake as a fraction of total energy (percent energy). A suggested maximum protein intake based on bodily needs, weight control evidence, and avoiding protein toxicity would be approximately of 25% of energy requirements at approximately 2 to 2.5 g ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1, corresponding to 176 g protein per day for an 80 kg individual on a 12,000kJ/d diet. This is well below the theoretical maximum safe intake range for an 80 kg person (285 to 365 g/d).

"Two clearly separate areas of interest can be identified in regard to protein intake, the first being the current debate on the merits of increased protein intake at the expense of carbohydrates in relation to weight loss and diabetic glycemic control, the second being the long-standing interest of those in the health, fitness, and body building fraternity with increased protein intake for perceived benefits in muscle development."

"Essentially dietary protein requirement is described as the minimum level of protein necessary to maintain short-term nitrogen balance under conditions of controlled energy intake and is quantified as the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) in the US" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6N224N?page=2) )

"This is despite the fact that no studies have evaluated the upper limit of amino acid intake (21), and no formal risk assessment paradigm for intakes of amino acids that are in significant excess of physiological requirements have been established (22). This should be a concern for any health professional advocating a high protein diet." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6N224N?page=3) )

"However, the role of dietary protein and amino acids in modulating insulin and glucagon secretion are less clear, as is an understanding of what fraction of amino acid load contributes to structural/functional protein needs, oxidation, gluconeogenesis, or a combination of all three" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6N224N?page=3) ) ^e68058

"Rudman et al. (27) found that the maximal rate of urea excretion (MRUE) in healthy individuals was 55 mg urea N ∙ h-1 ∙ kg-0.75, which is reached at an intake level of 0.53 g protein N/kg-0.75" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6N224N?page=4) )

"At higher protein intakes there is no further increase in urea excretion rate, but a prolongation of the duration of MRUE, often in excess of 24 h (27)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6N224N?page=4) )

"In a further investigation of the fate of protein nitrogen, Rudman et al. (27) were able to quantify the temporary accumulation of urea in body water during MRUE and the amount hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6N224N?page=4) )

"as not all protein is deaminated and converted to urea. A certain amount of protein as indicated by the RDA is used directly for structural/functional purposes, including bone and soft tissue growth, maintenance and repair plus production of hormones, antibodies, and enzymes, thus not requiring deamination." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6N224N?page=4) )

"The dangers of excessive protein intake should not be underestimated and have been recognized historically through the excess consumption of lean wild meat by early American explorers leading to a condition referred to as "rabbit starvation syndrome," in which symptoms included nausea and diarrhea followed by death within 2 to 3 wk (29)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6N224N?page=5) )

"If diets relatively high in protein are to be tolerated it is likely that an evolutionary mechanism exists to metabolize some amino acids in peripheral tissues. Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) such as leucine, valine, and isoleucine, which yield high levels of ATP relative to their yield of glucose, are excellent candidates for this and are known to be oxidized in muscle tissue (71)."
