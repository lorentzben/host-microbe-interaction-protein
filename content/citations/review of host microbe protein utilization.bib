  abstract = {The ruminal microorganisms are an excellent example of how the body adapts to different feeding sources on its own initiative. The ruminants, in contrast to monogastric creatures such as chickens, create an ideal environment for a group of microorganisms in the rumen compartment, which then uses their powers of cellulose digestion and nitrogen conversion to allow them to use the forge more efficiently than their monogastric counterparts, such as cattle (Davis, 1973; Wu, 1993). While the rumen microorganisms' nitrogen utilization is estimated to be greater than 67\% of non-protein nitrogen (Firkins et al., 2007), the poultry nitrogen emission is estimated to be greater than 27 \% of total emission (Battye et al., 1994). Based on that, the idea of presenting some nitrogen assimilation bacteria to broiler chickens was shaped to reduce the nitrogen emissions associated with poultry production. This study aims to investigate the effect of the bacteria strains Selenomonas ruminantium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38, Ruminococcus albus strain 7, and Bacteroides ruminocola subsp. brevis B14 (new name Prevotella bryantii B14), on the broiler performance, dietary amino acids from bacterial protein availability, and the broiler gut microflora in three separate experiments. The first experiment was in vitro, the second experiment was in vivo, and the third was a bioinformatics experiment. To evaluate the effect of those novel probiotics on the broiler performance, nitrogen utilization, and the broiler cecal microflora's microbial diversity, richness, evenness, and composition. The results showed that the R. albus 7 had the highest nitrogen utilization (P {$>$} 0.05) in the first experiment, the highest BWG (P {$>$} 0.05), slightly the lowest FCR, slightly the lower nitrogen emission, slightly the higher body N/ feed N ratio, and slightly lower FC N/ feed N ratio in the second experiment. R. albus 7 treatment showed no significant effect on the broiler cecal microflora's microbial diversity, richness, evenness, and composition in the bioinformatic study in the third experiment. Based on these results, it was concluded that R. albus 7 is a potential novel nitrogen reduction probiotic.},

  abstract = {Bacteria in nature appear as diverse communities, which may comprise of hundreds of different species. The shared capacity of the bacterial communities to adapt in any imaginable set of conditions is remarkable. Many bacteria have growth requirements, as yet undiscovered, which are fulfilled by their natural habitats. Indeed, bacterial communities have members specialized on different functions and providing vital elements to other bacteria living in the same community. Therefore, most bacteria cannot easily be isolated from their habitats by the routine culturing methods used in most laboratories today. To overcome the difficulties in culturing of individual microbes, modern approaches analyse the structure of bacterial communities by determining the characteristic features of the microbial DNA extracted from the community samples. Using such techniques we have found that 90\% of the bacteria in the chicken gastrointestinal tract represent previously unknown species. Furthermore, more than half of the 640 different species found represent previously unknown bacterial genera. Bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract derive most of their carbon and energy from dietary compounds which are either resistant to attack by digestive fluids or absorbed so slowly by the host that bacteria can successfully compete for them. The performance improvements on use of a growth promoting feed antibiotic is due to factors such as reduced competition for nutrients in the small intestine, reduced local inflammation due to control of pathogens, and reduced size of intestine. Since bacterial species differ in their substrate preferences and growth requirements, the chemical composition and structure of the digesta largely determines the species distribution of the bacterial community in the gastrointestinal tract. Consequently, it should be possible to shift the microbial community from harmful to non-harmful bacteria by changing the diet.},

  abstract = {Considerable debate has taken place over the safety and validity of increased protein intakes for both weight control and muscle synthesis. The advice to consume diets high in protein by some health professionals, media and popular diet books is given despite a lack of scientific data on the safety of increasing protein consumption. The key issues are the rate at which the gastrointestinal tract can absorb amino acids from dietary proteins (1.3 to 10 g/h) and the liver's capacity to deaminate proteins and produce urea for excretion of excess nitrogen. The accepted level of protein requirement of 0.8g {$\cdot$} kg-1 {$\cdot$} d-1 is based on structural requirements and ignores the use of protein for energy metabolism. High protein diets on the other hand advocate excessive levels of protein intake on the order of 200 to 400 g/d, which can equate to levels of approximately 5 g {$\cdot$} kg-1 {$\cdot$} d-1, which may exceed the liver's capacity to convert excess nitrogen to urea. Dangers of excessive protein, defined as when protein constitutes {$>$} 35\% of total energy intake, include hyperaminoacidemia, hyperammonemia, hyperinsulinemia nausea, diarrhea, and even death (the ``rabbit starvation syndrome''). The three different measures of defining protein intake, which should be viewed together are: absolute intake (g/d), intake related to body weight (g {$\cdot$} kg-1 {$\cdot$} d-1) and intake as a fraction of total energy (percent energy). A suggested maximum protein intake based on bodily needs, weight control evidence, and avoiding protein toxicity would be approximately of 25\% of energy requirements at approximately 2 to 2.5 g {$\cdot$} kg-1 {$\cdot$} d-1, corresponding to 176 g protein per day for an 80 kg individual on a 12,000kJ/d diet. This is well below the theoretical maximum safe intake range for an 80 kg person (285 to 365 g/d).},

  abstract = {In biology, molecular terms with the suffix ``-omics'' refer to disciplines aiming at the collective characterization of pools of molecules derived from different layers (DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites) of living organisms using high-throughput technologies. Such omics analyses have been widely implemented in poultry research in recent years. This first part of a bipartite review on omics technologies in poultry health and productivity examines the use of multiple omics and multi-omics techniques in poultry research. More specific present and future applications of omics technologies, not only for the identification of specific diagnostic biomarkers, but also for potential future integration in the daily monitoring of poultry production, are discussed in part 2. Approaches based on omics technologies are particularly used in poultry research in the hunt for genetic markers of economically important phenotypical traits in the host, and in the identification of key bacterial species or functions in the intestinal microbiome. Integrative multi-omics analyses, however, are still scarce. Host physiology is investigated via genomics together with transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques, to understand more accurately complex production traits such as disease resistance and fertility. The gut microbiota, as a key player in chicken productivity and health, is also a main subject of such studies, investigating the association between its composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) or function (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, metabolomics) and host phenotypes. Applications of these technologies in the study of other host-associated microbiota and other host characteristics are still in their infancy.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background                                With the advent of metagenomics, the importance of microorganisms and how their interactions are relevant to ecosystem resilience, sustainability, and human health has become evident. Cataloging and preserving biodiversity is paramount not only for the Earth's natural systems but also for discovering solutions to challenges that we face as a growing civilization. Metagenomics pertains to the in silico study of all microorganisms within an ecological community in situ                 ,                 however, many software suites recover only prokaryotes and have limited to no support for viruses and eukaryotes.                                                        Results                                In this study, we introduce the                 Viral Eukaryotic Bacterial Archaeal                 (VEBA) open-source software suite developed to recover genomes from all domains. To our knowledge,                 VEBA                 is the first end-to-end metagenomics suite that can directly recover, quality assess, and classify prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral genomes from metagenomes.                 VEBA                 implements a novel iterative binning procedure and hybrid sample-specific/multi-sample framework that yields more genomes than any existing methodology alone.                 VEBA                 includes a consensus microeukaryotic database containing proteins from existing databases to optimize microeukaryotic gene modeling and taxonomic classification.                 VEBA                 also provides a unique clustering-based dereplication strategy allowing for sample-specific genomes and genes to be directly compared across non-overlapping biological samples. Finally,                 VEBA                 is the only pipeline that automates the detection of candidate phyla radiation bacteria and implements the appropriate genome quality assessments.                 VEBA                 's capabilities are demonstrated by reanalyzing 3 existing public datasets which recovered a total of 948 MAGs (458 prokaryotic, 8 eukaryotic, and 482 viral) including several uncharacterized organisms and organisms with no public genome representatives.                                                        Conclusions                                The                 VEBA                 software suite allows for the in silico recovery of microorganisms from all domains of life by integrating cutting edge algorithms in novel ways.                 VEBA                 fully integrates both end-to-end and task-specific metagenomic analysis in a modular architecture that minimizes dependencies and maximizes productivity. The contributions of                 VEBA                 to the metagenomics community includes seamless end-to-end metagenomics analysis but also provides users with the flexibility to perform specific analytical tasks.                 VEBA                 allows for the automation of several metagenomics steps and shows that new information can be recovered from existing datasets.},

  abstract = {``Normal'' for the gut microbiota                            For the benefit of future clinical studies, it is critical to establish what constitutes a ``normal'' gut microbiome, if it exists at all. Through fecal samples and questionnaires, Falony               et al.               and Zhernakova               et al.               targeted general populations in Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively. Gut microbiota composition correlated with a range of factors including diet, use of medication, red blood cell counts, fecal chromogranin A, and stool consistency. The data give some hints for possible biomarkers of normal gut communities.

Here, we analyzed two independent, extensively phenotyped cohorts: the Belgian Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP; discovery cohort;               N               = 1106) and the Dutch LifeLines-DEEP study (LLDeep; replication;               N               = 1135). Integration with global data sets (               N               combined = 3948) revealed a 14-genera core microbiota, but the 664 identified genera still underexplore total gut diversity. Sixty-nine clinical and questionnaire-based covariates were found associated to microbiota compositional variation with a 92\% replication rate. Stool consistency showed the largest effect size, whereas medication explained largest total variance and interacted with other covariate-microbiota associations. Early-life events such as birth mode were not reflected in adult microbiota composition. Finally, we found that proposed disease marker genera associated to host covariates, urging inclusion of the latter in study design.},

These early-life events can have long-standing consequences: facilitating tolerance to environmental exposures or contributing to the development of disease in later life, including inflammatory bowel disease, allergy, and asthma. Recent studies have begun to define a critical period during early development in which disruption of optimal host-commensal interactions can lead to persistent and in some cases irreversible defects in the development and training of specific immune subsets. Here, we discuss the role of early-life education of the immune system during this ``window of opportunity,'' when microbial colonization has a potentially critical impact on human health and disease.},

Up till now there is no reliable faecal marker to measure gut barrier failure under field conditions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify a faecal protein marker for diminished intestinal barrier function due to enteric diseases in broilers. To assess this, experimental necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis in broilers were used as models for gut barrier failure. Ovotransferrin was identified as a marker for gut barrier failure using a proteomics approach on samples from chickens with necrotic enteritis. These results were confirmed via ELISA on samples derived from both necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis trials, where faecal ovotransferrin levels were significantly correlated with the severity of gut barrier failure caused by either coccidiosis or necrotic enteritis. This indicates that faecal ovotransferrin quantification may represent a valuable tool to measure gut barrier failure caused by enteric pathogens.},

Therefore, the poultry industry is increasingly implementing novel technologies to optimize and enhance bird welfare and productivity. This second part of a bipartite review on omics technologies in poultry health and productivity highlights the implementation of specific diagnostic biomarkers based on omics-research in the poultry industry, as well as the potential integration of multi-omics in future poultry production. A general discussion of the use of multiple omics technologies in poultry research is provided in part 1. To date, approaches focusing on one or more omics type are widely used in poultry research, but the implementation of these omics techniques in poultry production is not expected in the near future. However, great potential lays in the development of diagnostic tests based on disease- or gut health-specific biomarkers, which are identified through omics research. As the cost of omics technologies is rapidly decreasing, implementation of multi-omics measurements in routine poultry monitoring systems might be feasible in the more distant future. Therefore, the opportunities, challenges and requirements to enable the integration of multi-omics-based monitoring of bird health and productivity in future poultry production are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Microbial colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract of newly hatched chicks starts at hatch, seeded from the immediate hatching environment, and quickly results in dense colonisation. The role of ecological factors in gut colonisation has been extensively investigated, as well as the role of micro- and macronutrients in supporting and selecting for bacterial species highly adapted for utilising those nutrients. However, the microbial community contained in poultry feed and its influence on colonisation and maturation of gut microbiota has not been directly addressed. In this study, we compared the microbiota found in poultry feed, with the microbiota of ileum, cecum and excreta, to identify substantial overlap in core microbiotas of the compared groups. We then investigated the microbiota present in raw feedstuffs: meat and bone meal, wheat, corn, canola, barley, soybean, millrun, sorghum, poultry oil, oats, limestone and bloodmeal from four geographically distinct feedstuff suppliers. Each of the feedstuffs had diverse microbial communities. The meat and bone meal and bloodmeal samples had the most complex and distinct microbial populations. There was substantial overlap in the phylogenetic composition found in the grain and seed samples: barley, canola, corn, millrun, oats, sorghum, soybean meal and wheat. Issues related to methodology, viability of microbial communities in the gut and feed, and the implications for biosecurity are discussed.},

One evolutionary driving force for maintaining this metabolically active microbial society is to salvage energy from nutrients, particularly carbohydrates, that are otherwise nondigestible by the host. Much of our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which members of the intestinal microbiota degrade complex polysaccharides comes from studies of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent and genetically manipulatable component of the normal human and mouse gut. Colonization of germ-free mice with B. thetaiotaomicron has shown how this anaerobe modifies many aspects of intestinal cellular differentiation/gene expression to benefit both host and microbe.

  abstract = {Nitrogen acquisition is a major challenge for herbivorous animals, and the repeated origins of herbivory across the ants have raised expectations that nutritional symbionts have shaped their diversification. Direct evidence for N provisioning by internally housed symbionts is rare in animals; among the ants, it has been documented for just one lineage. In this study we dissect functional contributions by bacteria from a conserved, multi-partite gut symbiosis in herbivorous Cephalotes ants through in vivo experiments, metagenomics, and in vitro assays. Gut bacteria recycle urea, and likely uric acid, using recycled N to synthesize essential amino acids that are acquired by hosts in substantial quantities. Specialized core symbionts of 17 studied Cephalotes species encode the pathways directing these activities, and several recycle N in vitro. These findings point to a highly efficient N economy, and a nutritional mutualism preserved for millions of years through the derived behaviors and gut anatomy of Cephalotes ants.},

  abstract = {Background and aims Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the top 10 most widely used drugs in the world. PPI use has been associated with an increased risk of enteric infections, most notably Clostridium difficile. The gut microbiome plays an important role in enteric infections, by resisting or promoting colonisation by pathogens. In this study, we investigated the influence of PPI use on the gut microbiome. Methods The gut microbiome composition of 1815 individuals, spanning three cohorts, was assessed by tag sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The difference in microbiota composition in PPI users versus non-users was analysed separately in each cohort, followed by a meta-analysis. Results 211 of the participants were using PPIs at the moment of stool sampling. PPI use is associated with a significant decrease in Shannon's diversity and with changes in 20\% of the bacterial taxa (false discovery rate {$<$}0.05). Multiple oral bacteria were over-represented in the faecal microbiome of PPI-users, including the genus Rothia (p=9.8\texttimes 10-38). In PPI users we observed a significant increase in bacteria: genera Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and the potentially pathogenic species Escherichia coli. Conclusions The differences between PPI users and non-users observed in this study are consistently associated with changes towards a less healthy gut microbiome. These differences are in line with known changes that predispose to C. difficile infections and can potentially explain the increased risk of enteric infections in PPI users. On a population level, the effects of PPI are more prominent than the effects of antibiotics or other commonly used drugs.},

  abstract = {Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is characterized by altered immunological and metabolic pathways. Metabolomics may therefore increase pathophysiological understanding and could develop into characterization of biomarkers for diagnosis and IBD treatment response. However, no uniform metabolomic profiles have been identified to date. This systematic review aimed to identify faecal metabolomic signatures in paediatric IBD vs controls, and to describe metabolites associated with disease activity and treatment response.A literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Studies assessing faecal metabolomics in paediatric patients \&lt; 18 years with IBD [de novo, active, inactive] with comparative groups [IBD vs non-IBD; responders vs non-responders] were included. The quality of included studies was assessed according to the Newcastle\textendash Ottawa Scale.Nineteen studies were included [540 patients with IBD, 386 controls], assessing faecal short-chain fatty acids [SCFA] [five studies], amino acids [AA] [ten studies], bile acids [BA] [eight studies] and other metabolites [nine studies] using various methodologies. Significantly increased levels of AA [particularly phenylalanine], primary BA and lower levels of secondary BA were described in paediatric IBD compared to controls. Faecal SCFA results varied across studies. Additionally, responders and non-responders to exclusive enteral nutrition and infliximab showed differences in baseline faecal metabolites [based on BA, AA].This systematic review provides evidence for distinct faecal metabolomic profiles in paediatric IBD. However, results varied across studies, possibly due to differences in study design and applied analytical techniques. Faecal metabolomics could provide more insight into host\textendash microbial interactions in IBD, but further studies with standardized methodologies and reporting are needed.},

  abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa. L) has been intensively studied to ensure a stable global supply of this commodity in the face of rapid global climate change. A critical factor that decreases crop yield is drought, which has been analyzed in various ways through many researches. Microbiome-based studies of rice investigate the symbiosis between rice and bacteria, which has been proposed as a way to overcome problems caused by drought. Several rice-associated metagenomic profiles obtained under drought conditions have been reported since the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. To elucidate the future diversity of plants and microorganisms and to promote sustainable agriculture, we reanalyzed 64 of the publicly available 16S amplicon sequencing data produced under drought condition. In the process of integrating data sets, however, we found an inconsistency that serves as a bottleneck for microbiome-based sustainability research. While this report provides clues about the composition of the microbiome under the drought conditions, the results are affected by differences in the location of the experiments, sampling conditions, and analysis protocols. Re-analysis of amplicon sequencing data of the soil microbiome in rice fields suggests that microbial composition shifts in response to drought condition and the presence of plants. Among the bacteria involved, the phylum Proteobacteria appears to play the most important role in the survival of rice under drought condition.},

  abstract = {The 16S rRNA gene has been a mainstay of sequence-based bacterial analysis for decades. However, high-throughput sequencing of the full gene has only recently become a realistic prospect. Here, we use in silico and sequence-based experiments to critically re-evaluate the potential of the 16S gene to provide taxonomic resolution at species and strain level. We demonstrate that targeting of 16S variable regions with short-read sequencing platforms cannot achieve the taxonomic resolution afforded by sequencing the entire (\textasciitilde 1500\,bp) gene. We further demonstrate that full-length sequencing platforms are sufficiently accurate to resolve subtle nucleotide substitutions (but not insertions/deletions) that exist between intragenomic copies of the 16S gene. In consequence, we argue that modern analysis approaches must necessarily account for intragenomic variation between 16S gene copies. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate treatment of full-length 16S intragenomic copy variants has the potential to provide taxonomic resolution of bacterial communities at species and strain level.},

  abstract = {Poultry diets are primarily based on plant proteins, with carbohydrates serving as the principal source of energy. There is usually no problem digesting most of the sugars as well as starch in the poultry gastrointestinal tract (GIT). However, some carbohydrate fractions, such as dietary fibre (DF), are not hydrolyzed by avian gastrointestinal enzymes but are fermented by the resident anaerobic microflora. Unfortunately, problems can occur with the feeding of dietary fibre due to the physicochemical properties (i.e. viscosity) of the non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs). It has been shown that components of NSPs, including pentosans (arabinoxylans), pectins, and {$\beta$}-glucans have negative effects in the poultry gastrointestinal tract. The anti-nutritive nature of NSPs in poultry diets has been well documented, but data regarding the fermentation of these and other carbohydrates by cecal microorganisms are limited. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are highest in the cecum compared with other areas of the avian gastrointestinal tract. It has been suggested that the short-chain fatty acids may inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria whilst in addition providing some energy-yielding substrates to the host animal after absorption. The objective of the current paper is to provide an overview of carbohydrate fermentation in the avian ceca as well as to focus on some potential advantages to the bird of this fermentation.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technology provides an efficient method for evaluating microbial ecology. Different bioinformatics pipelines can be used to convert 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing data into an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) table that is used to analyze microbial communities. It is important to assess the robustness of these pipelines, each with specific algorithms and/or parameters, and their influence on the outcome of statistical tests. Articles with publicly available datasets on the oral microbiome were searched for, and five datasets were retrieved. These were from studies on changes in microbiota related to smoking, oral cancer, caries, diabetes, or periodontitis. Next, the data was processed with four pipelines based on VSEARCH, USEARCH, mothur, and UNOISE3. OTU tables were rarefied, and differences in {$\alpha$}-diversity and {$\beta$}-diversity were tested for different groups in a dataset. Finally, these results were checked for consistency among these example pipelines. Of articles that deposited data, only 57\% made all sequencing and metadata available. When processing the datasets, issues were encountered, caused by read characteristics and differences between tools and their defaults in combination with a lack of detail in the methodology of the articles. In general, the four mainstream pipelines provided similar results, but importantly, P-values sometimes differed between pipelines beyond the significance threshold. Our results indicated that for published articles, the description of bioinformatics methods and data deposition should be improved, and regarding reproducibility, that analysis of multiple subsamples is required when using rarefying as library-size normalization method.},

  abstract = {Over the years, research studies have shown there is a key connection between the microbial community in the gut, genes, and immune system. Understanding this association may help discover the cause of complex chronic idiopathic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Even though important efforts have been put into the field, the functions, dynamics, and causation of dysbiosis state performed by the microbial community remains unclear. Machine learning models can help elucidate important connections and relationships between microbes in the human host. Our study aims to extend the current knowledge of associations between the human microbiome and health and disease through the application of dynamic Bayesian networks to describe the temporal variation of the gut microbiota and dynamic relationships between taxonomic entities and clinical variables. We develop a set of preprocessing steps to clean, filter, select, integrate, and model informative metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics longitudinal data from the Human Microbiome Project. This study accomplishes novel network models with satisfactory predictive performance (accuracy = 0.648) for each inflammatory bowel disease state, validating Bayesian networks as a framework for developing interpretable models to help understand the basic ways the different biological entities (taxa, genes, metabolites) interact with each other in a given environment (human gut) over time. These findings can serve as a starting point to advance the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches and new biomarkers for precision medicine.},

Nearly 70\% of sequences from the ileum were related to those of Lactobacillus, with the majority of the rest being related to Clostridiaceae (11\%), Streptococcus (6.5\%), and Enterococcus (6.5\%). In contrast, Clostridiaceae-related sequences (65\%) were the most abundant group detected in the cecum, with the other most abundant sequences being related to Fusobacterium (14\%), Lactobacillus (8\%), and Bacteroides (5\%). Statistical analysis comparing the compositions of the different 16S rRNA libraries revealed that population succession occurred during some sampling periods. The significant differences among cecal libraries at 3 and 7 days of age, at 14 to 28 days of age, and at 49 days of age indicated that successions occurred from a transient community to one of increasing complexity as the birds aged. Similarly, the ileum had a stable bacterial community structure for birds at 7 to 21 days of age and between 21 to 28 days of age, but there was a very unique community structure at 3 and 49 days of age. It was also revealed that the composition of the ileal and cecal libraries did not significantly differ when the birds were 3 days old, and in fact during the first 14 days of age, the cecal microflora was a subset of the ileal microflora. After this time, the ileum and cecum had significantly different library compositions, suggesting that each region developed its own unique bacterial community as the bird matured.},

We used shotgun sequencing of microbial community DNA and targeted sequencing of bacterial 16               S               ribosomal RNA genes to gain an understanding of how microbial communities adapt to extremes of diet. We sampled fecal DNA from 33 mammalian species and 18 humans who kept detailed diet records, and we found that the adaptation of the microbiota to diet is similar across different mammalian lineages. Functional repertoires of microbiome genes, such as those encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes and proteases, can be predicted from bacterial species assemblages. These results illustrate the value of characterizing vertebrate gut microbiomes to understand host evolutionary histories at a supraorganismal level.},

Recent methodological advances have spurred the recognition of microbiomes as complex communities with important influences on the health and disease status of the host. In this minireview, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of the chicken gastrointestinal microbiome focusing on spatial and temporal variability, the presence and importance of human pathogens, the influence of the microbiota on the immune system, and the importance of the microbiome for poultry nutrition.

This observation of functional redundancy may have important implications for management of the microbiome.

"Lactobacilli also dominate the proventriculus, a thick-walled stomach, and the ventriculus (gizzard). The gizzard has been described as the 'teeth' of the gastrointestinal tract where a majority of mechanical and chemical breakdown of feed is performed (Ensminger, 1971; Rehman et al., 2007); the low pH of gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and pepsin limits the total number of cells below 108 g1 (Yeoman et al., 2012)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=2}{Oakley et al 2014:101})

"Here, we focus on the ceca as organs of particular interest as they harbor the highest microbial cell densities (up to 1011 cells g1), have the longest residence time (12-20 h) of digesta in the gastrointestinal tract, and are important sites for recycling of urea, water regulation, and carbohydrate fermentations contributing to intestinal health and nutrition (Ensminger, 1971; Clench \& Mathias, 1995; Sergeant et al., 2014; Waite \& Taylor, 2014)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=2}{Oakley et al 2014:101})

"In a metagenomic study of the chicken cecal microbiome, Qu et al. (2008) found that c. onefourth of assembled contigs were most closely related to transposes, suggesting that lateral gene transfer might be an important mechanism contributing to a 'pan-genome' under selective pressure for functional traits shared by multiple taxa." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3}{Oakley et al 2014:102})
\par
"In most commercial poultry operations in the United States, a diverse microbial community in the housing environment (mainly in the litter) is carried over from one flock to the next and thus can serve as an important inoculum for the chick gastrointestinal microbiome (Liljebjelke et al., 2003)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3}{Oakley et al 2014:102})
\par
"This possibility is supported by re-analysis of data from a recent paper (Oakley et al., 2013) to show c. 50 bacterial genera common to litter, fecal, and carcass samples from two flocks followed longitudinally from 'farm to fork' (Table 1). The presence of several putative pathogens (Table 1) may have important implications for this management practice (Pedroso et al., 2013)."

"Through the life span of a commercial broiler (typically 42 days), significant changes in the taxonomic composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome have been observed (Lu et al., 2003) and are well reviewed elsewhere (Rehman et al., 2007; Yeoman et al., 2012; Stanley et al., 2014)."

"Interestingly, variability is much higher for fecal vs. cecal samples (Fig. 3b vs. 3a), supporting previous suggestions (Stanley et al., 2014) that fecal samples may not be properly representative of the gastrointestinal tract due to differential mixing effects and the less frequent voiding of the ceca compared to the rest" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=4}{Oakley et al 2014:103})

"Escherichia coli is anotherc-proteobacteria present in the chicken intestine at low abundance throughout the life of the animal. Some E. coli strains are capable of causing opportunistic secondary infections in birds following other respiratory tract pathogens such as infectious bronchitis virus or Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Smith et al., 1985; Gross, 1990) in response to high ammonia levels in poultry houses, or physiological changes in its avian host such as egg peritonitis or salpingitis in response to egg laying (Landman et al., 2013)."

\par
"The clostridial population includes some species pathogenic for poultry such as Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum, and C. colinum (Calnek, 1997). C. perfringens causes necrotic enteritis in poultry and isolates pathogenic for poultry contain a novel toxin type that is not possessed by human pathotypes (Keyburn et al., 2010). Antibiotic feed supplements such as avoparcin, bacitracin, or virginiamycin are often used to prevent necrotic enteritis, and these antibiotics significantly affect the community structure of the intestinal microbiome (Lee et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2006; Lee, 2008)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6}{Oakley et al 2014:105})

"As an essential organ of the host mucosal immune system, the gut has evolved to carry out two apparently confounding tasks: nutrient absorption and pathogen defense." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6}{Oakley et al 2014:105})
\par
"The intestinal immune system includes a robust mucosal layer, tightly interconnected intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), secreted soluble immunoglobulin A (IgA), and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). It is well established that a beneficial microbial community has an important role in maintaining normal physiological homeostasis, modulating host immune system, and influencing organ development and host metabolism (Sommer \& Backhed, 2013)."

"Over 40 years ago, Nurmi and Rantala introduced the term competitive exclusion (CE) describing reduced Salmonella colonization in birds orally gavaged as newly hatched chicks with intestinal contents from salmonellaefree birds (Nurmi \& Rantala, 1973)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6}{Oakley et al 2014:105})
\par
"Early observations that very low levels of Salmonella can colonize the intestinal tract of young broiler chicks, while older birds are resistant to infection led to the transfer of microbial communities from adults into dayold chicks which increased the resistance to salmonellae colonization as predicted (Pivnick \& Nurmi, 1982; Cox et al., 1990)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})
\par
"Similar introductions of complex microbial communities have been used to successfully treat gastrointestinal disorders including recurrent C. difficile infections in humans (Anderson et al., 2012; Lawley et al., 2012; Van Nood et al., 2013), although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood in all cases." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})

"The majority of reported research shows that undefined mixtures from the intestinal tract of healthy adult birds are more effective in preventing Salmonella colonization than the defined mixtures that have been marketed" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})
\par
"Gastrointestinal microorganisms can have negative effects on the host such as overstimulation of the immune system, enzymatic digestion of intestinal mucus, breakdown of bile, or production of harmful amino acid catabolites (Gaskins et al., 2002), but a 'healthy' microbiota is considered a net benefit to the chicken."

"gastrointestinal microbial communities have been shown to exclude pathogenic taxa (Nurmi et al., 1992), promote beneficial development of the intestinal mucus layer, epithelial monolayer, and lamina propria (McCracken \& Gaskins, 1999; Shakouri et al., 2009), break down polysaccharides (Beckmann et al., 2006; Qu et al., 2008), and provide energy as amino acids and SCFA (van der Wielen et al., 2000; Dunkley et al., 2007" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})
\par
"SCFA are important nutrients for the host and are known to stimulate increases in absorptive surface area (Dibner \& Richards, 2005). SCFA also reduce colonic pH, which can inhibit bile catabolism and subsequent conversion to secondary bile acids (Christl et al., 1997)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})

"the intestinal microbiota can also act as a complementary exogenous source. Members of the gut microbiota are able to synthesize vitamin K as well as most of the water-soluble B vitamins, such as biotin, cobalamin, folates, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, and thiamine (Ichihashi et al., 1992)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})

"Several studies have shown that growth performance, feed efficiency, and gut health in broiler chickens can be improved by dietary prebiotics, nondigestible carbohydrates selectively stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria (Xu et al., 2003; Yusrizal \& Chen, 2003; Yang et al., 2008a b)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})

"For example, feed supplementation with 0.4\% fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) in broiler chickens significantly increased body weight gain, feed efficiency, the activities of protease and amylase, ileal villus height, and the growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (Xu et al., 2003)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})
\par
"Probiotics appear to be most effective during the initial development of the microbiota, or after any dietary change or stress and following antibiotic therapy and thus can be interpreted in the context of the ecological phenomena of primary and secondary succession in which a community is established or re-established following a disturbance" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})
\par
"Several studies have demonstrated that supplementing feed with probiotics containing Lactobacillus cultures can enhance body weight gain and feed efficiency and reduce mortality rate in broilers (Zulkifli et al., 2000; Kalavathy et al., 2003; Timmerman et al., 2006)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7}{Oakley et al 2014:106})

"In a search for probiotic strains related to chicken performance, Torok et al.

In the lowest portion of the small intestine, Lactobacillus spp. have been implicated as a causal factor in low performance (DeLange \& Wijtten, 2010), suggesting the location of colonization by probiotic strains may affect performance.

  abstract = {Abstract             Antimicrobial growth promoters (AGP) have played a decisive role in animal agriculture for over half a century. Despite mounting concerns about antimicrobial resistance and demand for antibiotic alternatives, a thorough understanding of how these compounds drive performance is missing. Here we investigate the functional footprint of microbial communities in the cecum of chickens fed four distinct AGP. We find relatively few taxa, metabolic or antimicrobial resistance genes similarly altered across treatments, with those changes often driven by the abundances of core microbiome members. Constraints-based modeling of 25 core bacterial genera associated increased performance with fewer metabolite demands for microbial growth, pointing to altered nitrogen utilization as a potential mechanism of narasin, the AGP with the largest performance increase in our study. Untargeted metabolomics of narasin treated birds aligned with model predictions, suggesting that the core cecum microbiome might be targeted for enhanced performance via its contribution to host-microbiota metabolic crosstalk.},

Here we describe the Illumina-based metagenomic sequencing, assembly and characterization of 3.3 million nonredundant microbial genes, derived from 576.7 Gb sequence, from faecal samples of 124 European individuals. The gene set, \textasciitilde 150 times larger than the human gene complement, contains an overwhelming majority of the prevalent microbial genes of the cohort and likely includes a large proportion of the prevalent human intestinal microbial genes. The genes are largely shared among individuals of the cohort. Over 99\% of the genes are bacterial, suggesting that the entire cohort harbours between 1000 and 1150 prevalent bacterial species and each individual at least 160 such species, which are also largely shared. We define and describe the minimal gut metagenome and the minimal gut bacterial genome in terms of functions encoded by the gene set.},

  abstract = {When normal individuals eat 0.33 g protein N/kg body weight (BW){$\frac{3}{4}$} per day, they excrete 10-15 mg urea N/h per kg BW{$\frac{3}{4}$}. If they now ingest (at 0 h) 0.27 (dose A), 0.40 (dose B), 0.53 (dose C), 0.94 (dose D), or 1.33 (dose E) g protein N/kg BW{$\frac{3}{4}$} (in the form of casein, ovalbumin, or lactalbumin), the rate of urea N excretion accelerates within 4 h. At dose C a maximal rate of urinary urea N excretion (MRUE) is reached, which averages 55 mg urea N/h per kg BW{$\frac{3}{4}$} and which persists for 16 h. Higher doses of protein do not further accelerate urea excretion, but prolong the duration of MRUE to 28 h (after dose E). Blood urea N (BUN) rises by 7-20 mg/100 ml during the first 8 h after dose C to E, and remains stable within {$\pm$}5 mg/100 ml during the ensuing 8-28 h of MRUE. Each increment of protein above dose C causes a further increment in plasma {$\alpha$}-amino N. During infusion of free amino acids at a rate of 110 or 165 mg amino acid N/h per kg BW{$\frac{3}{4}$} for 12 h, rate of urea excretion increases to the MRUE value produced by dose C-E of oral protein., These findings indicate that MRUE corresponds to a period of maximal rate of urea synthesis (MRUS). MRUS is greater than MRUE because one fraction of newly formed urea is hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract, and another fraction may accumulate temporarily in body water during the MRUE period. Oral neomycin reduces the proportion of urea hydrolyzed in the gut to less than 20\%; its extent is measured by recovery in the urine of a tracer dose of [14C]urea injected intramuscularly during determination of MRUE. Accumulation of urea in body water is estimated from increment in BUN during the period of MRUE measurement (8-24 h after dose E of casein) and from body water measured with 3H2O. Then MRUS is calculated as: ([mg urea N excreted between 8 and 24 h after dose E] + [BUN at 24 h - BUN at 8 h] \texttimes{} [body water]) \texttimes{} (100/\% recovery [14C]urea) \texttimes{} (1/kg BW{$\frac{3}{4}$}) \texttimes{} (1/16 h)., MRUS in 10 normal subjects averaged 65 mg urea N/h per kg BW{$\frac{3}{4}$} (range 55-76), and in 34 cirrhotics 27 mg urea N/h per kg BW{$\frac{3}{4}$} (range 6-64). Among 19 cirrhotic patients fed 40, 60, 80, or 100 g protein daily for successive 10 day periods, the occurrences of hyperammonemia, hyperaminoacidemia, and encephalopathy at each level of protein intake were inversely related to MRUS value.},

Specifically, we have an improved understanding of how pathogens are recognized by specific complement proteins, as well as how they trigger and evade them. Additionally, we have an improved understanding of locally derived complement proteins, many of which promote host defense. Moreover, intracellular complement proteins have been identified that facilitate local protection and barrier function despite pathogen invasion. Our review aims to summarize these advances in the field as well as provide an insight into the pathophysiological changes occurring when the system is dysregulated in infection.},

  abstract = {Daily light-dark cycles shape the physiology and activity patterns of nearly all organisms. Recent evidence that gut microbial oscillations synchronise circadian rhythms in host immunity and metabolism indicate that diurnal dynamics is a crucial component of microbiome function. However, their prevalence and functional significance are rarely tested in natural populations. Here we summarize the hallmarks of gut microbiota oscillations and the mechanisms by which they synchronise rhythms in host immunity and metabolism. We discuss the consequences for diverse biological processes such as host pathogen susceptibility and seasonal switches in metabolism, and outline how the breakdown of these circadian interactions, for example during senescence and as a consequence of urbanisation, may affect wildlife infection risk and disease. Lastly, we provide practical guidelines for the measurement of microbial oscillations in wildlife, highlighting that whilst wild animals are rarely available over a 24-hour period, characterising even parts of the cycle can be informative. Light-dark cycles are an almost universal environmental cue and provide a rare opportunity to generalise gut microbial responses across species. An improved understanding of how microbial rhythms manifest in wildlife is essential to fully comprehend their ecological significance.},

Emerging evidence supports a bidirectional relationship between disease progression and changes in microbiota membership and function. Thus, the study of the gut microbiome and host\textendash microbe interactions should provide critical insights into disease pathogenesis as well as leads for developing microbiome-based diagnostics and interventions for IBD. In this article, we review the most recent advances in understanding the relationship between the gut microbiota and IBD and highlight the importance of going beyond establishing description and association to gain mechanistic insights into causes and consequences of IBD. The review aims to contextualize recent findings to form conceptional frameworks for understanding the etiopathogenesis of IBD and for the future development of microbiome-based diagnostics and interventions.},

Male chicks of two broiler breeds (               n               = 156/breed) were cohoused in an open floor pen until day 7.

On day 14, chicks in the 12 treatment isolators (6 isolators/breed, 108 total) were challenged with               Salmonella               Typhimurium (ST) (1 \texttimes{}                                                                                                                        10                                              8                                                                                       CFU/ml) via oral gavage while the remaining chicks (               n               = 108) were given an oral gavage of sterile tryptic soy broth control (C). Ileal and cecal contents were collected on day 7 from 24 chicks of each breed, and on days 13, 17, 21, and 24 from two chicks per isolator. Samples underwent DNA extraction and PCR amplification to obtain 16S rRNA amplicons that were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq.               Salmonella               Typhimurium colonization in the cecum was not different in the two broiler breeds. The main effect of breed had the greatest impact on the ileum microbiota of broilers 7~days of age where SG broilers had significantly lower diversity and richness compared to CONV broilers (               p               \&lt; 0.05).               Salmonella               Typhimurium challenge consistently caused a change in beta diversity. Regardless of day or intestinal location, challenged broilers had many amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with decreased abundance of likely beneficial bacteria such as               Mollicutes               RF39,               Shuttleworthia               ,               Flavonifractor               , and               Oscillibacter               compared to broilers that were unchallenged with               Salmonella               Typhimurium (               p               \&lt; 0.05). Additionally, there was a difference in the timing of when the microbiota alpha and beta diversity of each breed responded to               Salmonella               Typhimurium challenge. Thus, both broiler breed and               Salmonella               Typhimurium can impact the intestinal microbiota.},

Flavonifractor is positively correlated with body weight and average daily gain in broilers given Bacillus subtilis as a probiotic (Zhang et al., 2021). Shuttleworthia may also contribute to nutrient absorption because it contributes to carbohydrate and lipid metabolic pathways (Chen et al., 2020).

However, small peptides may be crossing from these barriers and absorbed from different regions of the intestine. These peptides as small, mini or small peptides called bioactive peptides. Bioactive peptides have defined as peptides with quasi-hormone or drug like activity that eventually modulate physiological function through binding interactions to specific receptors on target cells. Bioactive peptides may be classified as antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, antithrombotic, antihypertensive, opioid, immune modulator, mineral binding and anti-oxidative. Most of the final protein digestive products that are absorbed are individual amino acids, with lower values absorption of small peptides. The peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) is primarily responsible for the absorption of dietary di-and tripeptides from the small intestinal. Currently, there is an interest in small peptides in pharmaceutical research and developments are being evaluated in clinical trials. The aim of this review is to summarize the existing knowledge for a better understanding of the challenges about protein digestion, small peptide absorption and oral delivery enhancers with an emphasis on small peptides.},

  title = {Effects of Diets with Different Phosporus Availability on the Intestinal Microbiota of Chickens and Pigs},
  author = {Tilocca, Bruno},
  date = {2019-01-01},
  abstract = {In the research works of the present thesis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics were employed to investigate the gut microbiota of chickens and pigs kept at experimental diets with varying amount of calcium-phosphorus (CaP) and supplemented MP. This represents a valuable approach to investigate the bacterial specimens involved in the P absorption, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of how the intestinal bacteria adapt to a new diet and which metabolic routes are affected by changing levels of supplemented P and/or MP. Two major experimental trials were performed during the investigation. The first one was conducted on chickens operating a modulation in the dietary levels of Ca, P and MP. This trial highlighted a shift in the composition of the crop and ceca-associated microbial community depending on the composition of the diet fed. Also, investigated protein inventory revealed that the stress condition due to the reduced P availability is mirrored in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT)-associated microbiota. Marked differences were observed in the functions of the bacterial community in the case of P-available diets versus P-deficient ones. Protein repertoire of the first case draws a thriving microbial community focused on complex and anabolic functions. Contrariwise, the bacterial community in the case of P-lacking diets appears to deal with catabolic functions and stress response. The second trial was conducted on pigs and attempts to define the dynamics featuring the microbiota adaptation to a new challenging diet composed of different protein sources and varying levels of Ca and P. Statistical evidences reveal a stepwise adaptation of the fecal microbiota to the experimental diets fed. Both DNA-based approach and metaproteomics independently reveal three main adaptation phases: -before the feeding of the experimental trial (i.e. Zero), -the response of the microbial community to the challenging factor (i.e. MA) and, finally, - the newly achieved homeostatic balance (i.e. EQ). As observed in the first trial, feeding of the experimental diets impairs the overall fecal microbiota composition, stimulating the presence of phase-specific bacterial specimens and a characteristic relative abundance of the shared ones. Bacterial families responsible for the phase-specific architecture of the fecal microbiota are also active in the biochemical pathways driving the functional peculiarities of each adaptation phase. A deeper investigation of the identified protein repertoire revealed that the observed statistical differences among the adaptation phases are uniquely due to the Ca and P composition of the diets fed. None of the observed effects can be attributed to the diverse protein sources supplemented with the diets. Functional categorization of the identified protein inventory depicts three diverse functional assets of the microbial community. Specifically, prior the feeding of the experimental diets, bacteria are hypothesized to live under homeostatic condition, since they appear to be involved in complex and highly-specialized functions. Following the administration of the experimental diets microbial community changes its functional priority and reduce the expression of highly specialized functions to focus on more essential ones. Proteins involved in complex functions such as widening the substrates array and facing complex sugars tend to increase in abundance while the new homeostatic balance is achieved. Altogether, data from both trials provide useful information for future studies aimed to design effective breeding strategies finalized to reduce the P supplementation in the routinely breeding of livestock and maintain a balanced microbial activity in the animal GIT. Investigation of the dynamics of the porcine microbiota provides instructions on the minimal exposure time required from the intestinal microbiota to adapt to a new dietary composition. This is of fundamental importance for the design of future studies aimed to confirm and/or continue our results. Moreover, the anatomical and physiological similarities occurring between humans and pigs, make our findings of interest for future human nutritional studies, where the mechanisms and lasts of the microbiota adaptation process is still object of discussion.},

``Phosphorus (P) is the second most abundant mineral in the animal body after calcium (Ca). Approximately 80\% of the body P is mineralized as hydroxyapatite, the main mineral composing bones and teeth.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``The remaining 20\% of P is commonly found in the internal organs and body fluids where it is involved in a variety of physiological functions of vital importance.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``Indeed, P is a building block for the nucleic acids and regulatory phosphoproteins, hence, of essential importance for the cell growth and differentiation, besides the transmission of the genetic code.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``Inorganic phosphate (PO43-) contributes to maintaining osmotic pressure and the acid-base balance.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``Moreover, P plays a pivotal role in the energetic metabolism and energy transfer via AMP, ADP and ATP with strong implications both at cellular (i.e. glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, protein synthesis, fatty acid transport, Na+/K+ pump) and systemic level (i.e. control of appetite, efficiency of feed utilisation) [1-4].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``Chickens and pigs diets are mainly based on cereals assumption'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``In cereals, P is mostly present in the seed coat, where 70-80\% of the total phosphorus is stored in the form of phytate (myoinositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate, InsP6) [5, 6].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``Plants and cereals are rich in phytases and acid phosphatases, the enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of phytate to low-molecular inositol phosphates (InsP5, InsP4, and InsP3), with the consequent release of one, two, and three PO43- molecules, respectively [9]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``Natural sources of phytases are plants, gut microbes and intestinal epithelial cells. However, abundance and activity of phytase in the latter two is rather reduced in monogastric animals (including chickens and pigs), leading to a reduced bioavailability of the organic phosphorus content in the feedstuff [11]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13) So phosphorous is in an inaccessible format so j it just passes through
\par
``This, in turn, results in a direct excretion of the bound phosphorus through the kidneys along with other bivalent cations complexing the phytate [10, 12].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``Of these, supplementation of microbial phytases in the diet composition is among the most promising strategies, enabling both for increased availability of phosphorus and its reduced renal excretion [10]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13)
\par
``Microbial phytases (MP) are produced intracellularly by Gramnegative bacteria, whereas Gram-positive bacteria and fungi produce these enzymes'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 13) This is cool!

\par
``Diet is one of the major environmental factors shaping the composition and activity of the microbial community harboured in the host intestine [13, 14].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 14)
\par
``In this context, a large number of diets have been optimized in order to improve diverse aspects of animal husbandry such as stimulation of a beneficial bacterial community and enhance of digestive functions [15]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 14)
\par
``The old notion of ``organism'' intended as a singular entity is nowadays being outclassed, to accept the novel view of the ``superorganism'' or ``metaorganism''.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 14) Are we sure about this?
\par
``This innovative perspective integrates the functional districts of the body along with its associated microbial community [16, 17]. The ensemble of microorganisms harbored in a given ecological niche (e.g. the gut) is referred as ``microbiota''; whereas, it is defined ``microbiome'' the microbial community inhabiting a given ecological niche along with their genetic elements and the relationships occurring among members and the environmental habitat where they survive [18].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 14) Microbiome includes relationships
\par
``At birth, animals are essentially sterile but immediately after birth all body surfaces (i.e. skin, oral cavity, vagina) and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are colonized by an impressive number of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses [19, 20].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 14)
\par
``At this stage, the diverse physico-chemical features of each anatomical site enable the maturation of a site-specific microbiota, which composition is the result of the environmental influence and the continuous competition and coexistence between microbial specimens [17].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 15)
\par
``The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota is the most investigated microbial community in both humans and animals. The gut microbiota of adult animals is mainly composed of bacteria, but also virus, fungi, archaea and protozoa are included.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 15)
\par
``This huge potential of gene products enables for a wide array of metabolic activities of the intestinal microbiome. Commensal microorganisms colonizing the intestine establish mutualistic relationships that concern a variety of function and physiological processes, including organ development and morphology [24, 25], modulation of the host's immune system [26, 27] and shaping of the metabolic and digestive activity [28, 29].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 15)
\par
``The chicken GIT comprises three upper segments (i.e. crop, proventriculus and gizzard) and three lower segments (i.e. small intestine, ceca and large intestine). Crop represent the food'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 15)
\par
``storage segment and fermentation processes initiate in this organ.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``Feed digestion continues in the proventriculus, also known as the glandular stomach, following the addition of hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes to the feed.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``Gizzard is the mechanical stomach providing the mashing and mixing of the feed particles.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``The small intestine is further divided into three main sections. Duodenum represents the first section; here, the acidic secretion from the upper gastrointestinal tract are mixed with the bile and pancreatic juices, leading to a sudden alkylation of the environment that marks the beginning of the digestive processes.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``It has been estimated that 95\% of the fat digestion occurs in the duodenum [30, 31].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``Jejunal segment extends from the duodenal loop until the Meckel's diverticulum. Main feature of this section is represented by its large size, enabling the digestion and adsorption of the major nutrients, despite a reduced retention time of 40-60 minutes [32-34].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``Ileum is the third segment of the small intestine, it ends at ileo-cecal junction and plays a pivotal role in the absorption of water and minerals. Only a minor activity has been observed in digestion and absorption of fat, carbohydrates and proteins [35].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``Ceca in chickens are two blind sacs that mark the joint point between the small and the large intestine. In these segments, materials of ileal and renal origin are subjected to long retention times, enabling for most of the electrolytes and water absorption [36]. Moreover, the ceca are an important site for the fermentation of any residual raw material with the consequent production of SCFA and B-group vitamins. Ceca empty their content two to three times per day, producing cecal droppings, whose color and texture are used to evaluate the normal functionality of the chicken\' s digestive tract [36, 37].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``The large intestine represents the last small segment of the digestive tract where occur the reabsorption of the last water content in the fecal material and the digestive wastes are mixed along with the wastes from the urinary system.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``Crop and gizzard share a very similar microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus spp. and Clostridiaceae. Slight differences are imputable to the reduced fermentation activity of the gizzard reflected as a reduced amount of Enterococcus spp. and Bifidobacteria spp. in its microbiota composition [39].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``Duodenal microbiota is almost exclusively composed of Lactobacillus spp. (up to 99\% of the total diversity), but Streptococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae may also be abundantly identified [40].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``Despite being dominated by Lactobacillus spp., the ileum is considered as a source of novel bacteria, including butyrate-producing species and other novel bacteria involved in nutrient availability and absorption; Clostridium spp., Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)
\par
``spp. are also found to dominate the ileal environment [39, 41, 42]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 17)
\par
``Cecal microbiota is the most investigated GIT segment since it is an important site of fermentation, enabling the digestion of food rich in cellulose, starch, and resistant polysaccharides. Moreover, the cecum is also the principal site of water reabsorption and nutrient transport and absorption. Therefore, elucidation on the microbial profile harbored in this section provide insights on the mechanisms of food utilization and open new frontiers for the animal husbandry optimization. Ceca is the most colonized section and is featured by a very high bacterial diversity. Here, the most abundant bacterial specimens are Clostridiaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Lactobacillus spp., Proteobacteria, and unknown Firmicutes [39].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 17)

``Moreover, phenotypic characterization of the cultured fraction encounters the additional problem that many bacteria, even phylogenetically diverse, share many phenotypic traits, besides their capability of growing in the same selective media and growing conditions [81].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 22)

``Here, the microbial composition is determined through a direct extraction of the bacterial DNA from the intestinal environment, avoiding the cultivation step, thus the loss of the uncultivable specimens. Universal primers are subsequently adopted to amplify regions of the 16S rRNA gene, creating a clone library of the amplified fragments [81].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 22)

``In DGGE studies, 16S rRNA amplicons are separated through a gradient of DNA denaturant (e.g. urea), enabling the separation of DNA fragments of similar size on the basis of their sequence properties. Assuming that every sequence variant represents a different bacterial specimen, the profile produced by this technique indicates the overall taxonomic diversity of the investigated microbiota in a rapid and cost-effective manner [87]. Similar information are also provided by TGGE technique although profile produced by this technique depends on the application of a gradient of temperature (instead of urea) to discriminate 16S rRNA fragments according to their sequence properties [91].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 23) I've never hard of these methods
\par
``To this purpose, one of the primer adopted in the 16S rRNA gene amplification must be fluorescently labelled. Marked 16S rDNA fragments are subsequently subjected to restriction through restriction enzymes that cut the DNA sequence at definite recognition sites'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 23)
\par
``The community profile is finally depicted through a size-by separation of the terminal restriction fragments (i.e. the fluorescently labelled restriction fragments) through capillary electrophoresis. The laser detection acquires the size of the terminal fragments along with the relative fluorescence intensity providing a comprehensive snapshot of the microbiota composition [88, 92].''

``Although considered as single disciplines, none of the single omics science is able to provide a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the biology of the investigated consortia, for which purpose an integrative approach of all these omics sciences is required [82]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 24)

``Metagenomics is a community-based approach that employs the study of the microbial genomes collected from the environmental niche where the microorganisms coexist, enabling the study of their phylogenetical, physical and functional features in a culture-independent manner.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 24)

\par
``Nowadays, 454 Roche pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing by synthesis are the most frequently adopted techniques [94, 96].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 24) And now even long sequencing
\par
``The read length currently achieved with this technology is around 150 bp and nearly 300 bp in the case of the paired-end approach. Multiplexing of the sample is strongly supported by this technology [94, 100, 101].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 25)
\par
``Error rate reported in this technology is far smaller than this of 454 Roche. However, the reduced reads length of the Illumina technology resulted in a greater proportion of unassembled reads with important consequences for the functional annotation and/or the neglect of low abundant specimens [102].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 25)
\par
``Although featured by the lowest error rate among all NGS technologies, the provided reads cannot exceed 50bp making difficult and unreliable the functional annotation of the reads, but providing interesting results while adopted in resequencing studies [103]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 25)

``Third Generation Sequencing (TGS). Features of the emerging technology rely on the sequencing of entire single molecules of DNA, avoiding the biases introduced by the step of DNA fragmentation, PCR-based construction of cluster and phased sequencing. Moreover, TGS exploit the high catalytic rates and processivity of the DNA'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 25)
\par
``polymerase, enabling the sequencing of longer reads in a shorter time, when compared with the ``previous'' SGS technology.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 26)
\par
``TGS technologies are grouped into three main categories depending on the principle exploited to inspect the DNA molecule [104, 105]. Single Molecule Real Time sequencing (SMRT, Pacific Bioscience) is the first TGS technology; it is based on the observance of a DNA polymerase while it synthesizes a ssDNA molecule, using labelled nucleotides [106]. Nanopore sequencing technology inspects the DNA molecule sequence by measuring the translocation of nucleotides across a nanopores-containing membrane. Nucleotides are cleaved by the ssDNA molecule and driven through the nanopore via differential salt concentration [107]. Third category of sequencing technologies relies on the direct observation of the DNA throughout the use of advanced atomic microscopy techniques that enable the visual observation and chemical detection of the DNA molecule building blocks, simultaneously [108].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 26)
\par
``Metatranscriptomics is an emerging discipline based on the NGS platforms (mainly Roche and Illumina), aimed to investigate the gene expression of the whole microbial community [93].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 26)
\par
``Indeed, metagenomics provides information about all the potential functions a given microbial community is capable of, but does not provide indication on the effective gene expression (or gene dynamics) of the microbial community under determined circumstances [94, 109].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 26) So it's hypothetical
\par
``information about all the potential functions a given microbial community is capable of,'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 26)
\par
``indication on the effective gene expression (or gene dynamics) of the microbial community under determined circumstances'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 26)
\par
``metatranscriptomics enable a comprehensive annotation of the structure of the transcribed genes, highlighting their start- and stop-site, and assessing the potential splicing variants (or protein isoforms) per each of the expressed gene [110].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 26) Great for eukaryotes
\par
``Although the sequencing technology is the same adopted in metagenomics, key differences are represented by the selective removal of the interfering nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, t-RNA, rRNA) and m-RNA to cDNA transcription prior to library production and its subsequent sequencing [111]. A comprehensive review on the RNA-seq technology is provided in [112] and [113].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 26)
\par
``Although of enormous importance, metatranscriptomics lack to consider the cellular organization and regulation levels governing the process of mRNA translation and protein maturation (e.g. controlled proteolysis, protein turnover, post-translational modification etc.), which greatly impact the final expression of the genome itself.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 27)
\par
``On this basis, one could argue that metaproteomics and metabolomics (addressing the small molecules/metabolites) provide the most realistic picture of the key effectors that directly mediate the metabolic functions operated by the organisms at the specific moment of sampling [115].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 27)
\par
``Early proteomics investigations were performed through 2DE, often complemented by spot detection and MS characterization [114]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 27)
\par
``An improvement of this technology is represented by 2D-DIGE which employs diverse dyes in a single electrophoresis run, overcoming the issue of the scarce reproducibility among multiple 2DE runs, and enabling a direct comparison of several samples in a high-fidelity manner [114]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 27)
\par
``Although these techniques are successful for microbial isolates, interest in the investigation of more complex samples, such as the microbiota, leads to the advent of high-performance MS platforms'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 27)
\par
``MS is currently the dominant approach for almost all proteomics investigations. It fulfils the technological requirements for a proteomic investigation that include high throughput processing, sensitive analyte detection, wide dynamic range, mass accuracy, ability to characterise and resolve peptide sequences.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 27)
\par
``Improvements of the actual MS technologies enable proteomics measurements that provide a wide array of information such as differential proteins expression (e.g. overtime or following experimental treatments), investigation of sub-proteomes (i.e. protein profile of the subcellular structures), post-translational modification (PTM) pattern, protein-protein interactions, and absolute protein quantitation [115].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 27)
\par
``MS-based proteomics protocols are mainly distinct into two major branches: top-down- and bottom-up-proteomics. The first is a straightforward strategy, where the complex proteins mixture is separated via liquid chromatography (LC) prior the mass spectrometry (MS) or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) measurements. This protocol is particularly useful when interested in the protein identity but also in its whole molecular form and the presence of isoforms. However, analysis might be severely complicated by the range of possible protein modification (e.g. truncation, SNPs, PTM) affecting the protein mass as predicted from the genome sequence. In addition, the protocol still suffers from drawbacks related to separation and detection of large proteins ({$>$}50 kDa). These limitations, coupled with the intrinsic challenge of the metaproteomes (e.g. increased sample complexity, species variability and protein homology), preclude the adoption of the top-down proteomics for the investigation of complex samples such as the microbiota [115, 116].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 27)
\par
``Bottom-up (or shotgun) proteomics includes additional processing steps that enable far deeper proteomics measurements. Here, proteins are primarily digested in an enzyme-specific manner (e.g. trypsin) to peptides.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``Peptides are subsequently separated via LC prior to their MS/MS measurements.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``Fragmentation spectrum resulting from the first MS measurement (MS1) indicate the parent ion mass spectrum of the peptides directly eluting from the LC system; whereas the tandem mass spectrum (MS2) provide insights on the fragmentation pattern and sequence information of the previous parent ions. Altogether, mass spectra are acquired and serve as a bar-code that univocally identify a given peptide [117].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``Key point in the experimental proteomics protocols is represented by the efficient protein separation prior to their measurements, either via top-down or bottom-up proteomics'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``In this context, gelbased and gel-free proteomics approaches can be distinguished, depending on the use of an intermediate, gel-mediated, pre-fractionation step of the complex proteins mixture.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``Gel-based proteomics is also known as the classical proteomics workflow, expecting a preseparation of the protein mixture through SDS-PAGE or 2DE.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``Nowadays, a variety of offline LC systems, simplifying the complex mixtures upfront the LC-MS/MS instrument, are also employed. These perform the protein separation according to one or multiple dimensions (e.g. isoelectric point, charge, hydrophobicity, size) and are usually compatible with the advanced online separation technologies such as the ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC), providing a better separation of the complex proteins mixture, thus enabling improved protein detection rate [115, 122, 123].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``Metabolomics provides a snapshot of the metabolites suite (metabolome) produced by a given cell, or consortia, at the moment of sampling, enabling their link back to the ongoing physiological processes [124].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``In the context of metabolomics, it is defined ``metabolite'' any molecule smaller than 1 kDa [125]; this includes intermediates and end-products of metabolic processes, hormones, and other signaling molecules.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``Similarly to transcriptome and proteome, metabolome is very dynamic; therefore, its investigation under diverse circumstances provide precious'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 28)
\par
``information on the causality of a given phenotype or, inversely, the systemic effects of specific substances (e.g. drugs) and other experimental treatments on the targeted cell lines or even the microbiota [126].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 29)
\par
``Main steps in metabolome investigation include the pre-separation of the complex metabolites mixture, following the cell lysis and purification of the extracted metabolites. Metabolites separation is generally accomplished through HPLC, enabling for a wide range of metabolites to be analyzed at a high sensitivity.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 29)
\par
``Gold standard for the metabolites detection is represented by MS, where, similarly to proteomics, information on the metabolite IDs and subsequent quantitation is computed back on the basis of the mass spectral fingerprint and the fragmentation pattern. Although HPLC-LC-MS is the most used approach metabolomics, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is also widely used in analysis that specifically targets a reduced number of metabolites [124].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 29) It would be good to review material from class
\par
``Metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics are strongly dependent on the quality and availability of the (meta-) genomes, used as a blueprint for the mRNA and protein identification, respectively.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 29)
\par
``Although the huge advances in the sequencing technologies, it is still difficult to obtain complete strain-specific genomes and, in the context of the microbiota evaluation, only partial population genomes are generally available.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 29)

``Commonly used metagenomics tools are MEGAN (MEtaGenome ANalyzer), IMG/M (Integrated Microbial Genomes/Metagenomes), and MG-RAST (MetaGenome-Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology).'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 29)

``These, although based on different algorithms and a slightly different statistics, enable the taxonomic and functional annotation of the metagenomic sequences, and allow the comparative evaluation of multiple datasets'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 29)
\par
``A typical LC-MS/MS experiments generate hundreds of thousands of fragmentation spectra. Here, the MS1 provide information on the mass-to-charge (m/z) of the intact peptide along with its amino-acidic composition whereas the MS2, providing information of the fragmentation pattern of each parent ion, determine the correct amino-acidic order.''

``Clearly, this enormous amount of data cannot be manually elaborated and a wide variety of bioinformatics software and tools is nowadays available to perform the computational operations, required to translate the myriad of spectra into a meaningful output that is both concise and informative [115].''

\par
``Similarly to metagenomics tools, proteomics/metaproteomics-committed tools are based on diverse algorithms and statistics, resulting in varying performance that, for each tool, depends on several factors such as sample complexity, separation efficiency and quality of the reference database [127]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 30)
\par
``Three main strategies can be employed to obtain a suitable reference database.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 30)
\par
``The first option is to use the metagenome sequence of the exact same sample or arising from a comparable community/habitat. This is considered the best option since has been associated with an improved identification rate'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 30)
\par
``A second choice is to create an artificial, in silico metagenome (pseudometagenome) that includes genome sequences of microbial species supposed to be present in the microbial community of interest. This strategy has been demonstrated to be effective [130], but a priori knowledge of the taxonomic complexity is required.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 30)
\par
``The third option expects a survey search before the ``official'' main search. The survey is conducted against a publicly available database (e.g. NCBInr) and the list of identified proteins is exported either unfiltered or weakly filtered, in order to obtain a comprehensive database to use in the later main search. This approach enables the use of small-sized database (leading to a higher identification rate) and avoids the bias introduced with the manual selection of the microorganisms. Further taxonomic levels may also be implemented from publicly available repositories [127].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 30)
\par
``Chapter 1 20 sequences on the basis of the parental ion masses and their fragmentation pattern provided respectively from the MS1 and MS2 of the tandem mass spectrum. This will provide the peptide sequence of peptides that are not included in the current metagenomes as well as enable insights on the PTM and protein polymorphisms. Although of great interest, the accuracy and speed of this groundbreaking approach still need substantial improvements to facilitate its widespread implementation in the ``routinely'' practice [115, 131].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 31) This is a wild idea
\par
``Detailed metaproteomic characterization of a given microbial community requires a quantitative assessment of the identified protein repertoire. The methods applied for protein quantification are distinguished as label-based- or label-free approach depending on the need to label the target proteins to gain quantitative information.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 31)
\par
``Because of the independence of any cultivation step and the ability to estimate protein amount without any labelling procedure, the label-free quantification is the most suitable approach for metaproteomic studies [127, 132, 133]. However, this requires high reproducibility LC-MS/MS data.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 31)
\par
``Indeed, quantification is based on either spectral counting (SC) or signal intensity (SI). Quantification through SC relies on the assumption that the number of fragment spectra mirrors the abundance of the peptide the spectra belong to. Normalized Spectra Abundance Factor (NSAF) is considered an improved version of the SC, since it estimates the protein abundance considering the effect of the protein size, thus avoiding the overestimation of larger proteins. Main software adopted for SC and NSAF quantification are Scaffold, Proteo IQ, APEX, CENSUS etc; a comprehensive review of these tools is provided in [127, 132, 133].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 31)
\par
``The SI-based quantification relies on the peptide ion abundance at specific retention times to estimate protein abundance. Although it is performed by a variety of software (e.g. MaxQuant, Elucidator, Open MS, SIEVE), the label-free quantification provided by MaxQuant is currently the most used, enabling an accurate detection and comparison of changes in the abundance of both high- and low- abundant proteins [127]'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 31)
\par
``Key points of the MaxQuant software reside in the integrated algorithms performing the process of ``ID transfer'' and ``peak normalization'' leading to improved peptide ID and accurate relative protein quantification, respectively [134].'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 31)
\par
``Another important task of the bioinformatics in the field of metaproteomics concern the annotation of identified proteins into predicted functional classes and clustering of the metaproteome dataset into functional groups.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 31)
\par
``Data repositories can be distinguished on the basis of the annotation type. UniProt KB, for instance, is further divided into Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL. The first comprises the only entries whose annotation has been reviewed and manually annotated; whereas, TrEMBL entries are not reviewed and ``only'' automatically annotated.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 31)
\par
``Other data repositories commonly used are Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 31)

\par
``Diverse other software and web-based application are nowadays available for this purpose, such as Web MGA, Cytoscape, IPath, DAVID and others (as reviewed in [127]) that retrieve and integrate functional annotation from diverse sequence repositories to provide a more comprehensive functional annotation of the queried metaproteomics dataset.''

``The microbial community harboring the GIT of chickens has been investigated mainly in relation to its spatial microbial diversity [56, 135, 136]. A variety of studies is also focused on the investigation of the avian gut microbiota following dietary supplementation of antimicrobials [47, 137], probiotics [50, 138, 139], and high-energy feed formulations [140].

``Despite cultivation being a sound technique to characterize the physiological properties of microorganisms [1], there are severe drawbacks in using this as a tool for characterizing bacterial communities.

Due to the progress in data generation and bioinformatic processing Illumina pyrosequencing is recently used as well. Several tools are available for the annotation of open reading frames on the contigs, MG-RAST [9], MEGAN5 [10], IMG/M [11], Metarep [12] and MicroScope [13].

``However, no increased abundance of Bacteroidaceae due to the dietary MP addition was observed and no Erysipelotrichaceae members were found in the present metaproteomic investigation.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 89)
\par
``Nevertheless, a higher bacterial diversity in the microbiome of crop and ceca sections was highlighted with the present approach. The discrepancy in the results from the same samples is imputable to the different methods. The amplification steps of T-RFLP and amplicon pyrosequencing analyses, including a possible primer bias and the presumed overestimation of taxa with a higher number of 16S rRNA genes, are probably the reason of the reduced heterogeneity found in the microbiota composition'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 89)
\par
``On the other hand, this step allows a higher sensitivity to target minor bacterial families which are missing in the metaproteomic approach due to the lack of genomic sequences.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 89)
\par
``Similarly, inconsistencies between DNA- and protein-based microbiota assessment was described by Tang et al. [11]. They also showed that the correlation between the potential and active bacterial community is not always possible since the species identification in proteomics was different to that of 16S rRNA gene sequencing.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 89)

``PERMANOVA analysis of the total datasets of both sections was done to check for significant differences between diets. Crop samples showed that the only pair of treatments MP0 \textendash{} MP12500 across P factor were statistically significant (p = 0.048).'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 89)
\par
``The entries of the statistically different treatments were subjected to SIMPER analysis, using a strict cut-off threshold (99.99\%), to identify single proteins that caused the dissimilarity between treatment groups. These proteins were functionally classified by grouping them into COG categories (Fig 3).'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 90)
\par
``In MP12500 metaproteome, lipid metabolism (I) was uniquely identified and three categories were more abundant in comparison with MP0 such as translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (J), carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G) and amino acid transport and metabolism (E) (Figure E in S2 file).'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 90)
\par
``Protein data of the cecal samples showed that proteins belonging to translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (J) were more abundant (23\%) in the BD- samples than in the BD+ ones (14\%) (Fig 3). In contrast, proteins of the carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G) group were more abundant, increasing from 16\% in the BD\textendash{} to 24\% in the BD+ diets'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 90)
\par
``Based on these results, our initial hypotheses that the diets will affect the functional profile of the bacterial communities was accepted. Specifically, mineral P-available diets (BD+; MP+) stimulate a ``productive bacterial community'' where bacterial resources are focused on complex anabolic functions; while the microbial community present at low mineral P diets (BD\textendash{} ; MP0) is concerned in the stress response mechanisms, suggesting that the mineral P limitation affecting the host health status is also reflected as stress factor for the gut microbiota. This idea seems to be in accordance with a study of Tang et al., which correlated the expression of proteins involved in metabolic processes of carbohydrate, alcohol and proteins to a thriving microbial community [11]. Protein folding has been linked to the microbial stress response to the high temperature of the chicken body. In our results, the thriving condition is maintained by the adequate nutrients supplementation, while the main stress factor is represented by the lack of P. T'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 91)

``The metabolic potential of the chicken\' s fecal microbiota as assessed by Singh et al. [52] shows that the abundance of the ``carbohydrate metabolism'' SEED subsystem was stable between the metagenomes of low and high feed conversion rate chickens whereas SEED subsystems related to sulphur metabolism and motility/chemotaxis were statistically different.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 91)
\par
``The abundance intensities of the proteins, responsible for significant dissimilarities between experimental treatments in the two GIT sections, were additionally grouped according to KEGG biochemical pathways (Figure F in S2 file). In both sections, major biochemical pathways were identified in all experimental treatments, but only a low number of proteins within these pathways was shared between the different treatments, suggesting a diverse overall activity of'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 91)

``the microbial communities depending on the fed diets'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 92)
\par
``Additionally, differences in the abundance level of the common proteins across the diets were observed, indicating a probable modulation of the highly conserved functions of the microbiota on the attempt to shape an adequate response to the changing environment. Specifically, the higher abundance of the KEGG Orthologous system [53] for ``ribosome'' (KO 03010) and ``aminoacyl-t-RNA biosynthesis'' (KO 00970) observed in crop MP12500 samples, as well as the higher abundance of ``ABC transporters'' (KO 02010) registered in crop MP0 samples, suggest an increased metabolic activity, and an overall effort of the bacterial community to maximize the P uptake respectively for the MP+ and MP0 samples (Figure F in S2 file). Similar trend was observed in the cecal samples. The high-expression of several KOs such as ``glycolysis/gluconeogenesis'' (KO 00010, BD+ samples) and ``starch and sucrose metabolism'' (KO 00500, MP+ samples) indicate a productive bacterial community and a coexistence of the bacterial members in a thriving microenvironment.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 92)
\par
``Several KOs were found to be overrepresented in the MP0 treatments such as `pyrimidine metabolism' and `arginine and proline metabolism' (KO 00330). Their abundances decreased with the addition of MP, resulting in a more favorable ratio for the MP0 treatment (Fig 4 panel B and C). Conversely, `lysine biosynthesis' as well as `oxidative phosphorylation' registered an overrepresentation in MP0 in the only pair MP0/MP500, while a further MP addition (MP0/MP12500) led to a slight overrepresentation in the MP12500 sector.'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 92)

``Identified proteins were sorted into KEGG metabolic maps (S7 Table) in order to confirm the previous COG results and give further support to our hypothesis that experimental diets affect the protein expression of the microbial community'' (Tilocca, 2019, p. 93)

This idea seems to be in accordance with a study of Tang et al., which correlated the expression of proteins involved in metabolic processes of carbohydrate, alcohol and proteins to a thriving microbial community [11]. Protein folding has been linked to the microbial stress response to the high temperature of the chicken body.

Similar trend was observed in the cecal samples. The high-expression of several KOs such as "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis" (KO 00010, BD+ samples) and "starch and sucrose metabolism" (KO 00500, MP+ samples) indicate a productive bacterial community and a coexistence of the bacterial members in a thriving microenvironment."

  abstract = {The intestinal microbiota has a certain impact on the performance of broilers. However, the change of intestinal microbiota after 4\,weeks of age is not clear, and the mechanism of the effect of microorganisms on the weight change of broilers needs more exploration.           ,              ABSTRACT                            During the entire growth process, gut microbiota continues to change and has a certain impact on the performance of broilers. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to explore the dynamic changes in the fecal bacterial communities and functions in 120 broilers from 4 to 16\,weeks of age. We found that the main phyla (               Firmicutes               ,               Fusobacteria               ,               Proteobacteria               , and               Bacteroides               ) accounted for more than 93.5\% of the total bacteria in the feces. The alpha diversity of the fecal microbiota showed a downward trend with time, and the beta diversity showed significant differences at various time points. Then, the study on the differences of microbiota between high-weight (HW) and low-weight (LW) broilers showed that there were differences in the diversity and composition of microbiota between high- and low-weight broilers. Furthermore, we identified 22 genera that may be related to the weight change of broilers. The analysis of flora function reveals their changes in metabolism, genetic information processing, and environmental information processing. Finally, combined with microbial function and cecal transcriptome results, we speculated that microorganisms may affect the immune level and energy metabolism level of broilers through their own carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism and then affect body weight (BW). Our results will help to expand our understanding of intestinal microbiota and provide guidance for the production of high-quality broilers.                                         IMPORTANCE               The intestinal microbiota has a certain impact on the performance of broilers. However, the change of intestinal microbiota after 4\,weeks of age is not clear, and the mechanism of the effect of microorganisms on the weight change of broilers needs more exploration. After 4\,weeks of age, the alpha diversity of microorganisms in broiler feces decreased, and the dominant bacteria were               Firmicutes               ,               Fusobacteria               ,               Proteobacteria               , and               Bacteroides               . There were differences in microbiota diversity and composition between high- and low-weight broilers. Intestinal microorganisms may affect the immune level and energy metabolism level of broilers through their own carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism and then affect the body weight. The results are helpful to increase the understanding of intestinal microbiota and provide reference for the production of high-quality broilers.},

Noninvasive sampling methods, such as cloaca swabs, are often used to measure gastrointestinal microbiota diversity within an individual.

  abstract = {Background The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health and has placed pressure on the livestock industry to eliminate the use of antibiotic growth promotants (AGPs) as feed additives. To mitigate their removal, efficacious alternatives are required. AGPs are thought to operate through modulating the gut microbiome to limit opportunities for colonization by pathogens, increase nutrient utilization, and reduce inflammation. However, little is known concerning the underlying mechanisms. Previous studies investigating the effects of AGPs on the poultry gut microbiome have largely focused on 16S rDNA surveys based on a single gastrointestinal (GI) site, diet, and/or timepoint, resulting in an inconsistent view of their impact on community composition. Methods In this study, we perform a systematic investigation of both the composition and function of the chicken gut microbiome, in response to AGPs. Birds were raised under two different diets and AGP treatments, and 16S rDNA surveys applied to six GI sites sampled at three key timepoints of the poultry life cycle. Functional investigations were performed through metatranscriptomics analyses and metabolomics. Results Our study reveals a more nuanced view of the impact of AGPs, dependent on age of bird, diet, and intestinal site sampled. Although AGPs have a limited impact on taxonomic abundances, they do appear to redefine influential taxa that may promote the exclusion of other taxa. Microbiome expression profiles further reveal a complex landscape in both the expression and taxonomic representation of multiple pathways including cell wall biogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and several involved in energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Many AGP-induced changes in metabolic enzyme expression likely serve to redirect metabolic flux with the potential to regulate bacterial growth or produce metabolites that impact the host. Conclusions As alternative feed additives are developed to mimic the action of AGPs, our study highlights the need to ensure such alternatives result in functional changes that are consistent with site-, age-, and diet-associated taxa. The genes and pathways identified in this study are therefore expected to drive future studies, applying tools such as community-based metabolic modeling, focusing on the mechanistic impact of different dietary regimes on the microbiome. Consequently, the data generated in this study will be crucial for the development of next-generation feed additives targeting gut health and poultry production.,  Video Abstract Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-022-01319-7.},

"This highlights an important finding, namely that" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=19}{Zou et al 2022:145})
\par
"while microbial diversity in cecal datasets increased with age consistent with previous studies [7, 39, 56, 64], this was not the case for all sites and treatments (Supplemental Table~3)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=19}{Zou et al 2022:145})
\par
"Thus, by focusing only on the cecal microbiome, treatments predicted to be beneficial to gut health may ignore potential adverse effects that occur at another GI site." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=19}{Zou et al 2022:145})
\par
"Supporting this idea is the finding that co-occurrence networks were reorganized in the presence of AGPs, with the disruption of interactions involving several influential taxa." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"This disruption is consistent with a previous study of cow rumen microbiomes, in which antibiotics decreased the number of interactions and connectivity of their co-occurrence networks [65]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})

"These nuanced interactions between diet and AGP interaction may in part explain inconsistencies between studies that suggest either AGPs impact community structure (e.g., [18, 33, 66, 67]) or have only a minimal impact (e.g., [60, 64, 68])." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"Beyond community composition, it is important to investigate how AGPs might alter the function of the gut microbiome. To date, functional studies of the poultry gut microbiome have been limited to the application of metagenomics (whole microbiome shotgun DNA sequencing)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"Focusing on antimicrobial resistance genes, such studies reveal AGPs to have minimal impact on the abundance of such genes [69, 70]. However, in previous work, we used metatranscriptomics (whole microbiome RNASeq) to show that similar microbial communities in the mouse gut can exhibit dramatic differences in gene expression in different host genotypes [38]. Similarly, here we found that AGPs have a dramatic impact on the expression of microbial genes including many involved in metabolic pathways, cell wall biogenesis, and antimicrobial resistance." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"Relative to cecal samples, we found that the jejunum samples contained more reads of host and diet origin, suggesting a lower density of bacteria. Encouragingly, taxonomic profiles were similar between the 16S RNA survey samples and the metatranscriptomic samples," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"albeit with certain taxa exhibiting different levels of activity, suggesting our pipelines are relatively robust in terms of taxonomic assignment." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"Among the pathways altered by AGPs were those responsible for the production of energy and nucleotides. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown the following: (1) the murine gut microbiome alters metabolic pathway expression in the presence with antibiotics, with the effects driven by dietary components such as glucose and polysaccharides [49], and (2) bacteria respond to the stress of antibiotics through the diversion of ATP from core metabolic processes to drive the maintenance of ion gradients [48]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"For example, many changes in glycolytic enzyme expression in the cecal microbiome of 24-day old birds are associated with Lactobacillaceae with a corn-diet and Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae with a wheat-based diet. These findings raise an important consideration: to what extent are these changes in enzyme expression driven simply by changes in taxon abundance. We therefore compared fold-change differences in taxon abundance and global taxon expression with pathway-specific expression for individual taxa" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"Focusing on three pathways discussed above (glycolysis, purine metabolism, and cell wall biogenesis), we found that pathway-specific expression for most taxa deviates by at least twofold from either changes in their abundance or global taxon gene expression (Supplemental Fig.~12)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"As a consequence, investigations focused on the metabolic contributions of individual taxa within a community remain challenging" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})
\par
"Beyond the abrogation of the age-associated decrease in four metabolites associated with the urea cycle, we did not identify significant differences between AGP" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=20}{Zou et al 2022:146})

"treatment and any of the metabolites measured in host serum." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=21}{Zou et al 2022:147})
\par
"While it might be expected that host metabolite concentrations might correlate with the observed changes in expression of metabolic enzymes encoded by the microbiome, we note that our analysis only captured a limited number (139) of metabolites investigated." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=21}{Zou et al 2022:147})
\par
"In addition to metabolic interactions, which are reliant only on metabolites shared by enzymes and are therefore largely taxon agnostic, our ability to interpret metatranscriptomic data in the context of other bacterial systems is limited by the lack of appropriate resources." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=21}{Zou et al 2022:147})
\par
"this analysis is unable to capture interactions representing taxon-specific innovation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFHF8N5H?page=21}{Zou et al 2022:147})
\par
"To illustrate these issues, we constructed species-specific networks for the three most abundant taxa represented within the 24-day ceca samples from corn-fed birds (Lactobacillus reuteri, Ruminococcaceae bacterium, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium), using the STRING protein interaction database [75]. While we identified a core of conserved interactions involving homologs of genes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, ftsZ, secA, and secE, each species lacked detectable homologs for many other genes (Supplemental Fig.~13). Furthermore, we note that many interactions are not conserved for each of the three taxa while also identifying additional interactions not captured by the E. coli-based network. This highlights the need for more taxon-agnostic scaffolds, providing generic representations of bacterial systems, while at the same time, capable of presenting taxon-specific innovations."

"if the upregulation of glycolysis in Lactobacillaceae provides a beneficial effect for birds fed a corn diet, the same effects may require upregulation of glycolysis in Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae in birds fed a wheat diet."
