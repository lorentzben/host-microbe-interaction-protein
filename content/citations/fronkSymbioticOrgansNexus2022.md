### Abstract
Diverse plants and animals have evolved specialized structures to filter and house beneficial microbes. These symbiotic organs form crucial points of exchange between host and symbiont, are often shaped by both partners, and exhibit features that facilitate a suite of microbial services. While symbiotic organs exhibit varied function, morphology, and developmental plasticity, they share core features linked to the evolutionary maintenance of beneficial symbiosis. Moreover, these organs can have a significant role in altering the demographic forces that shape microbial genomes, driving population bottlenecks and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). To advance our understanding of these `joint phenotypes' across varied systems, future research must consider the emergent forces that can shape symbiotic organs, including fitness feedbacks and conflicts between interacting genomes.

"Given this mutuality, emergent effects, such as intergenomic epistasis, can shape trait outcomes. Thus, we must expand our view of trait evolution to consider phenotypic variance driven by both the host and symbiont genotype (and their heritability values), as well as environmental pressures that contribute to partner phenotypes [67-71]. One of the novel predictions that has arisen from these models is that the striking variation infitness outcomes seen in mutualism services is driven by diverse host × symbiont genotypic interactions [67,69,72,73]."

"With their rapid adaptation to novel conditions, microbes are predicted to evolve to exploit host resources and manipulate host traits toward selfishfitness interests, potentially altering the host phenotype and its interaction with the environmen" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T6ILBBFK?page=9) )

"To minimize conflict, symbiotic organs often exhibit structural and physiological features that allow the host to control microbial colonization, specificity, and proliferation within host tissues, often by regulating nutritional provisioning to microbes, and controlling vertical or horizontal transmission of microbes to new hosts [4,5,18,77]."
