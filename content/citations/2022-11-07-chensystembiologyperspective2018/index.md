### Abstract
A vast, complex and dynamic consortium of microorganisms known as the gut microbiome colonizes the human gut. Over the past few decades, we have developed an increased awareness of its important role in human health. In this review we discuss the role of the gut microbiome in complex diseases and the possible causal scenarios behind its interactions with the host genome and environmental factors. We then propose a new analysis framework that combines a systems biology approach, cross-kingdom integration of multiple levels of omics data, and innovative in vitro models to yield an integrated picture of human host–microbe interactions. This new framework will lay the foundation for the development of the next phase in personalized medicine.

"In line with this, a large body of evidence now supports a role for the gut microbiome in our predisposition for various diseases, including obesity (9), type 2 diabetes (T2D) (10), cardiovascular disease (11), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (6,12), cancers (13,14), depression (15) and Parkinson disease (16)."

"The gut microbiome of vegans, for example, is rather different from that of people with an omnivorous diet (19) and a western diet (i.e. high calorie and high fat intake) is associated with a less diverse microbial ecology than a diet with high fibre intake (6). Higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, fibre and red wine has been linked to higher abundances of beneficial bacteria including butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, anti-inflammatory Clostridiales and mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila (6,20)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VH7FZWLS?page=2) )

"One recent dietary intervention study showed that a high-fibre diet can promote short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacterial species, and these species sequentially exerted a beneficial effect on their host by lowering haemoglobin A1c level and diminishing metabolically detrimental compounds, thereby alleviating T2D (24" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VH7FZWLS?page=2) )

"For instance, the most heritable bacteria taxa (Christensenellaceae, Archaea, Tenericutes and Bifidobacteriaceae) are associated to traits including body mass index (BMI) and bacterial biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids, which are both also linked to insulin resistance (33" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VH7FZWLS?page=2) )

"Additive model the gut microbiome exerts an additive effect on the susceptibility of complex diseases, i.e. in addition to the known genetic and environmental factors" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VH7FZWLS?page=3) )

"adding the gut microbiome to the prediction model may not explain extra inter-individual variation but microbiome-targeting approaches can alleviate the impact of genetics and environmental factors on the susceptibility of complex diseases."

"This kind of causal model can be tested by transferring geneticor diet-modulated faecal microbiome from donors to receivers and assessing whether the corresponding phenotype was transmitted or not." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VH7FZWLS?page=3) ) ^f32d44

"Similarly, a comparison between 372 human faecal metatranscriptomes and 929 metagenomes identified both a 'house-keeping' core of metatranscriptomes that is universally expressed over time and highly variable metatranscriptional activity that may reflect dynamic regulation of microbial composition in response to environmental perturbations" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VH7FZWLS?page=4) )
