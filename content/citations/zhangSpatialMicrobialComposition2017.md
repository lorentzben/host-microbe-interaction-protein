### Abstract
Gastrointestinal microbiota is increasingly recognized as an important component of individual health, and therefore, our ability to quantify its diversity accurately is central for exploring different ways to improve health. Noninvasive sampling methods, such as cloaca swabs, are often used to measure gastrointestinal microbiota diversity within an individual. However, few studies have addressed to what degree differences exist in microbial community composition along the gastrointestinal tract, and measures obtained from the cloaca may not actually represent the diversity present elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we systematically characterized the gastrointestinal microbial community of the critically endangered Attwater's Prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri) by opportunistically sampling four different locations (ileum, cecum, large intestine, and cloaca) along the gastrointestinal tract of eight individuals. Spatial variation of microbial community was observed at different sampling locations within the gastrointestinal tract.

"For instance, the cecum is a unique morphological structure of the gastrointestinal tract, consisting of two blind pouches located at the junction of the small and large intestines [15] where fermentation of plant matter occurs, especially in herbivores and birds such as many galliformes that feed on plant material [16]. By contrast, the ileum is the last section of the small intestine, which typically maintains a more neutral pH and is responsible for absorption of the remaining products of digestion."

"Micrococcaceae was the most dominant bacterial family in half of the ileum (4/8), large intestine (4/8), and cloaca (5/8) samples. The microbial communities in the cecum were dominated by five to seven relatively high abundant (5.5-37.8 %) families including Enterobacteriaceae (13.9 % ± 13.4 %), Ruminococcaceae (12.9 % ± 7.6 %), Lachnospiraceae (10.6 % ± 4.5 %), Coriobacteriaceae (7.2 % ± 4.7 %), and Erysipelotrichaceae (3.9 % ± 6.2 %)."

"A large number of microbial taxa were present in all the four sampling locations, referred herein as theBcore microbiota.Â total of 50 microbial families and 70 genera occurred in all the four sampling locations (Fig. 2a, b). The core microbiota accounted for 99.3, 80.2, 80.2, and 84.7 % of total sequences in the ileum, cecum, large intestine, and cloaca samples, respectively (Fig. 2c)."

"Since 92.0 % of the total sequences were classified at the family level, abundant bacterial families were selected for LDA analysis. In the LDA chart, the cecum and cloaca microbiota clearly separated from that of the ileum and large intestine through the first and second discriminant functions, which explained 99.67 and 0.2917 % of total variances (Fig. 5). The third discriminant function only represented 0.0383 % of total variances separated the ileum and large intestine microbiota." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VGRAT35?page=8) )

"Relative abundances of ten out of twenty-three bacterial families were significantly different in the cecum compared to those in the other three locations (Fig. 6a). There were eight bacterial families that showed significantly different relative abundances between the cecum and both ileum and cloaca" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VGRAT35?page=8) )

"The aim of this study was to investigate if differences in microbiota exist among the sampling locations within the gastrointestinal tract in order to ascertain whether non-invasive sampling strategies, specifically at the cloaca, are sufficient to represent microbial diversity elsewhere in the intestine (e.g., ileum, large intestine, and cecum)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VGRAT35?page=9) )

"Concern exists, however, that sampling at the cloaca may not be the best approach for quantifying microbial diversity and abundance within an individual because spatial heterogeneity in microbiota among gastrointestinal regions has been observed among bird species [12, 13, 35], particularly when compared with the cecum ([36]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VGRAT35?page=9) )

"The extent of the difference is dependent upon the taxonomic level used for characterization (e.g., phylum or family) and the metric used for comparison, especially when comparing between the cecum and the other sample locations (ileum, large intestine, and cloaca).

"Among abundant taxa, two bacterial families showed significant differences between the cloaca and the large intestine. Therefore, when quantifying rare taxa (defined here as those comprising &lt;2 % of the total population in at least one sample by sequence count), cloaca sampling may not represent the gastrointestinal tract overall. The resident microflora may also be affected by secretions of other digestive organs located in the proximal end of the gut." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VGRAT35?page=9) )

"In contrast to our results, Choi et al. [35] found that broiler chicken microbiota of the large intestine were clustered together with the cecum, but separate from the ileum." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VGRAT35?page=9) )

"In contrast to our results, Choi et al. [35] found that broiler chicken microbiota of the large intestine were clustered together with the cecum, but separate from the ileum. Interestingly, broiler chickens empty their cecal contents into the large intestine several times per day, which may result in the higher similarity between the microbial communities of the large intestine and cecum in those birds [39]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VGRAT35?page=9) )

"The ileum is part of the lower small intestine where food nutrients are mainly absorbed, while the primary function of the avian large intestine is absorption of water and electrolytes. The avian cloaca is both an excretory and a copulatory organ; therefore, its microbial community can be affected by both the digestive system and mating behavior [40, 41]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VGRAT35?page=9) )

"In contrast to the digestive functions of the ileum, large intestine, and cloaca, the cecum is unique in that it is the location of carbohydrate fermentation and recycling uric acid for amino acid synthesis [45-47]," ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VGRAT35?page=9) )
