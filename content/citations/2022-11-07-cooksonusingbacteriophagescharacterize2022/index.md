### Abstract
As bacteriophage therapy is being investigated more as an alternative to antibiotics, laboratories are isolating and characterizing the functions of bacteriophages. Additionally, with large variations between gut microbiome studies and inconsistencies in results, there is a need for discrete characterization of specific gut microbes in situ. This hypothesis paper describes a method to utilize bacteriophages in order to outline the functions of specific gut bacteria in existing biological systems with minimal disturbance. Further, the effects of specific microbe depletion on gut bacterial composition and host health can theoretically also be measured.

"As the efficacy of antibiotics diminishes, bacteriophage ("phage") therapy is gaining more attention as a treatment to target unwanted microbes that cause bacterial infections" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=1) )

"In 1999, Ramesh et al. treated hamsters with C. difficile. While control animals died, the experimental animals that received phage treatment had a &gt;91% survival rate [1]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=1) )

"In addition to the bacteriophages themselves, isolation of lytic proteins from the bacteriophages is another possible avenue for alternative anti-microbial treatments. Phages encode two classes of enzymes: holins and endolysins." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=1) )

"it remains a challenge to control the species or strains of bacteria in situ by targeted enrichment or depletion due to the location of the gut microbiota and lack of specificity with current therapies." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=1) )

"Due to the specificity of binding and infection of bacteria by bacteriophages, the up-and-coming development of phage therapy gives rise to the potential to deplete certain species of bacteria in situ with unprecedented accuracy." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=1) )

"The native gut virome, " ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=2) ) has been proposed to strongly influence the diversity and overall composition of the gut bacteriome [13-15]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=2) )

"selection of appropriate candidate bacteria that are believed to impact health and disease based on previous studies is required to efficiently validate these findings while also limiting the need to characterize phages that specifically target each of the thousands of bacterial species that may be present in the gut." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=2) )

"native phages that contribute to the gut virome and may be involved in microbe-host interactions of interest," ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=2) )

"Utilizing phages to specifically deplete species or strains of bacteria will allow researchers to measure their impact on neighbouring microbe survival and microbial pathways." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=2) )

"Presumably, the depletion of one species of bacteria may affect the growth of others by interrupting cross-feeding behaviours or suppressing signals that inhibit growth, leading to enrichment or depletion of off-target bacteria as well. These changes in the relative abundance of bacteria in the gut microbiome can be measured by DNA sequencing (e.g. 16S rRNA, metagenomics) and compared to pre-treatment values. This, along with measurement of changes to metabolic output by metabolomics, will enable researchers to determine how certain bacteria interact with other bacteria and the host to impact microbe survival and overall metabolic output in the gut. It also helps to elucidate the role of the target species in the community as a whole." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=2) )

"For example, bacteriophages can be uptaken by immune cells to induce inflammatory responses by toll-like receptor signalling [25]." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G52VEZP6?page=2) )

"In the meantime, however, bacteriophages may be used as a technique to characterize microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions of gut bacteria. This will allow researchers to determine advantageous bacterial strains and combinations of species that interact with each other, as well as a potential host, to provide health benefits or promote disease."
