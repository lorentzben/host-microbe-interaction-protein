### Abstract
Poultry diets are primarily based on plant proteins, with carbohydrates serving as the principal source of energy. There is usually no problem digesting most of the sugars as well as starch in the poultry gastrointestinal tract (GIT). However, some carbohydrate fractions, such as dietary fibre (DF), are not hydrolyzed by avian gastrointestinal enzymes but are fermented by the resident anaerobic microflora. Unfortunately, problems can occur with the feeding of dietary fibre due to the physicochemical properties (i.e. viscosity) of the non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs). It has been shown that components of NSPs, including pentosans (arabinoxylans), pectins, and β-glucans have negative effects in the poultry gastrointestinal tract. The anti-nutritive nature of NSPs in poultry diets has been well documented, but data regarding the fermentation of these and other carbohydrates by cecal microorganisms are limited. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are highest in the cecum compared with other areas of the avian gastrointestinal tract. It has been suggested that the short-chain fatty acids may inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria whilst in addition providing some energy-yielding substrates to the host animal after absorption. The objective of the current paper is to provide an overview of carbohydrate fermentation in the avian ceca as well as to focus on some potential advantages to the bird of this fermentation.

“Starch serves as the major energy-yielding component in commercial poultry diets. The predominant monosacchrides in poultry diets are glucose and fructose, while the predom-” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 1) 

“inant disaccharide is sucrose (Larbier and Leclercq, 1994).” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2) 

“Digestion of non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) fractions tends to be more variable due to lack of digestive enzymes and their tendency to create a viscous environment within the intestinal lumen (Choct and Annison, 1992; Choct et al., 1996; Smith and Annison, 1996)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2) 

“NSPs can be hydrolyzed by enzymes produced by the cecal microflora or by supplementation of poultry diets with specific feed enzymes (Choct et al., 1999; Jamroz et al., 2002).” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2)  ^a18fb3

“undigested carbohydrates are transformed into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2) This happens in the ceca 

“The general scheme of the avian digestive tract includes the beak, oesophagus, crop, proventriculus, gizzard, small intestine, paired ceca, large intestine, and cloaca.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2) 

“the most developed ceca were found in granivores and species whose diet contained high levels of plant fibre or chitin.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2) 

“Many researchers have speculated about the role of the avian ceca. There is evidence that the ceca play a role in the microbial degradation of some carbohydrates (Jorgensen et al., 1996; Jamroz et al., 2002), absorption of water (McNab, 1973), microbial synthesis of vitamins (Coates et al., 1968), cholesterol digestion and absorption (Tortuero et al., 1975)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2)  ^1164ca

“and degradation of nitrogenous compounds (Goldstein, 1989)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 3) 

“In addition, it has been reported that only 10–60% of the bacteria in the ceca can be cultivated using anaerobic culture techniques (Zhu et al., 2002)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 3) 

“In other livestock species, maternal grooming and oral aerosols (i.e. coughing) are believed to be important ways of inoculating young animals.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 4) 

“The role of DF in poultry nutrition remains unclear.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 6) 

“The main problems associated with the feeding of NSPs to poultry are viscosity and water holding capacity.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 6) 

“Moreover, viscosity may hinder the interaction between substrates in the small intestine and lipases or bile salts and impair transport of hydrolytic products to the epithelial surface.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 7) 

“cecal hypertrophy (Redig, 1989)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 8) 

“Collectively, these results suggest that even small amounts of DF components can affect the fermentation processes in the poultry ceca and even cause hypertrophy of this organ” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 9) 

“However, in order to postulate on possible advantages that cecal NSP fermentation may have for the host animal, a closer examination of the fermentation end-products (i.e. SCFA) that are produced in the ceca is warranted.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 9)  ^e81e22

“These SCFA include butyrate, acetate, lactate, propionate, valerate, and isovalerate (Jamroz et al., 1998)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 9) 

“Tsukahara and Ushida (2000) reported that feeding a plant protein-based diet to chickens led to a higher production of SCFA than a diet based on animal protein” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 10) 

“most likely due to a higher concentration of DF components in the plant-based diet and perhaps a higher activity and density or both of the resident microflora.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 10) 

“Van der Wielen et al. (2000) who observed that acetate was present in 3-day-old chickens, while butyrate and propionate were first detected after 12 days.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 10) 

“After fermentation, protonated forms of SCFA are transported through the cecal epithelial membranes. Morton (1978) concluded that the amount of energy obtained from these SCFA is too low to meet all of the energy requirements of poultry.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 10)  ^2a06bf

“In ruminants, it is possible to determine absorption of SCFA by measuring the net disappearance of unlabelled or radioactively labeled SCFA from the reticulo-rumen filled with artificial buffer” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11) 

“In non-ruminants (e.g. pigs), SCFA are not metabolized in the stomach epithelia, so absorption may be measured by analyzing arterial and portal blood together with portal blood flow (Gäbel, 1995)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11) Potential research method  ^70400a

“more difficult to use a catheter due to the narrow diameter of the portal vein” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11) 

“Van der Wielen et al. (2000) demonstrated that high fermentation activity in chicken ceca was correlated with a lower pH” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11)  ^ccdce1

“this may inhibit some pathogenic bacteria by dissipating the proton motive force across the bacterial cell membrane (Russell, 1992)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11)  ^b11e4d

“McHan and Shotts (1993) observed a toxic effect of SCFA to some Enterobacteriacae, and in vitro studies showed a 50–80% reduction in Salmonella typhimurium counts in the presence of SCFA.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11) 

“More research is needed to characterize further the ability of certain SCFA to inhibit pathogenic bacteria” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11) 

“if fermentation of these DF constituents takes place in the cecum it may prove beneficial to the host animal by providing some energy for the bird and/or inhibiting pathogenic bacteria.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 12)
