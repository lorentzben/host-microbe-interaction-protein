### Abstract
The increasing global demand for poultry products, together with the growing consumer concerns related to bird health and welfare, pose a significant challenge to the poultry industry. Therefore, the poultry industry is increasingly implementing novel technologies to optimize and enhance bird welfare and productivity. This second part of a bipartite review on omics technologies in poultry health and productivity highlights the implementation of specific diagnostic biomarkers based on omics-research in the poultry industry, as well as the potential integration of multi-omics in future poultry production. A general discussion of the use of multiple omics technologies in poultry research is provided in part 1. To date, approaches focusing on one or more omics type are widely used in poultry research, but the implementation of these omics techniques in poultry production is not expected in the near future. However, great potential lays in the development of diagnostic tests based on disease- or gut health-specific biomarkers, which are identified through omics research. As the cost of omics technologies is rapidly decreasing, implementation of multi-omics measurements in routine poultry monitoring systems might be feasible in the more distant future. Therefore, the opportunities, challenges and requirements to enable the integration of multi-omics-based monitoring of bird health and productivity in future poultry production are discussed.

"the evolution of ever-increasing performance holds a higher risk of failures due to metabolic disorders in the highly productive birds and due to the fact that endemic and epidemic infectious diseases may cause more damage." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=2) )

"Such systems can provide indirect information on the health status of the birds. Direct information, however, still comes from regular inspection of the birds and laboratory analyses of samples taken from the birds by the farm veterinarian." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=2) )

"Without other clinical data and expertise in interpreting those datasets, there is a high risk of overinterpretation and unnecessary treatment offlocks" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=3) )

"These biomarkers can be measured in either the faeces or the blood, and easy and fast diagnostic tests, such as lateral flow assays or ELISAs, have the potential to be readily implemented in the routine health monitoring practices in poultry production." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=3) )

"Probably, a baseline measurement per farm, house or even production cycle will be necessary." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=3) )

"the gut microbiome not only regulates the intestinal physiological homeostasis but also has systemic effects that steer bird resistance towards environmental and infectious stressors (Kogut, 2019). Altogether, there is a lot of variability in microbiome composition, host molecular signals (such as protein or metabolite abundances), gut physiological parameters (e.g. intestinal villus height, crypt depth, or inflammatory T-cell infiltration) and bird performance between farms and between successiveflocks (Kers et al., 2018, 2019; Van Limbergen et al., 2020; Ringenier et al., 2021; authors' unpublished data)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=3) )

"When comparing the faecal ovotransferrin measurements between different experimental trials, a significant difference in baseline ovotransferrin levels of healthy birds is observed. However, within each trial, the experimental challenge results in a significant deviation from the baseline measurement, which is positively correlated with the macroscopically scored disease severity (Goossens et al., 2018)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=3) )

<i>What does this mean? ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=3)</i> )

"Goossens et al., 2018" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=3) )

"Given the complex, multifactorial nature of some important diseases challenging the modern poultry industry, together with the above described inter-flock variability in host and microbiome parameters, the development of robust, disease-specific biomarkers is not straightforward, and multi-omics approaches might be needed to identify discriminatory multi-omics signatures linked to each disease." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFQJ4A67?page=4) )

"In order to translate these multi-omics signatures to the practical conditions in thefield, further research should focus on the longitudinal monitoring of birds in commercial poultry houses. In such longitudinal monitoring, eachflock serves as its own control, thereby solving the problem of inter-flock variability. Data derived from continuous, real-time monitoring of environmental conditions should be supplemented with multi-omics measurements at specific pre-defined timepoints. In order to obtain a holistic profile of the bird's health status, these multi-omics measurements should target both the host and its microbiome."
