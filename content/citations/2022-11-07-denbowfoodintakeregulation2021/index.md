"Among the strongest evidence that food intake is regulated in birds is the temporal response to dietary amino acid imbalances." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=1) )

"The ability to discriminate among diets deficient in amino acids is dependent on the genetic background of the bird" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=1) )

"Noble et al., 1993" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=1) )

"Outside of the CNS, food intake is regulated by both the gastrointestinal tract and the liver (Denbow, 1994)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=1) )

"Denbow, 1994" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=1) )

"The crop does not appear to have a direct role in food intake regulation in that it does not appear to have receptors that modulate intake. However, it may restrict intake physically when its capacity is reached." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=1) )

"The gastrointestinal tract has osmoceptors that, when stimulated by hyperosmotic solutions, result in reduced food intake." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=1) )

"After absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, nutrients generally travel directly to the liver. Whereas in mammals absorbed lipids are packaged into chylomicrons, enter the lymphatic system, and are transported to the subclavian vein, in birds lipids are packaged into portomicrons that enter the hepatic portal vein and travel directly to the liver." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=1) )

"Therefore, the liver is strategically located to monitor nutrient intake and control food intake in birds." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=1) )

"The list of peptides known to alter food intake is large and growing (Cline and Furuse, 2012)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=4) )

"Cline and Furuse, 2012" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=4) )

"NPY is one of the most abundantly expressed peptides in the CNS. With a highly conserved sequence of 36 amino acids" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X38K5RNI?page=4))
