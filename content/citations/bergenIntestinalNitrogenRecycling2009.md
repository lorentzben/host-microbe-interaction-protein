"Both enterocytes and small intestine luminal microorganisms can degrade peptides and amino acids (AA)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )


<a id="^92d927"></a> "Although, undoubtedly, some indispensable AA may arise from N cycling and microbial synthesis in the intestinal lumen, the actual net impact on protein nutrition status appears to be limited in humans and animals." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) ) ^92d927

"Finally, new evidence indicates that gut microbial metabolism may be enhanced by prebiotics and probiotics, with the prospects of new treatment paradigms for eliminating undesirable secondary N metabolites and ameliorating complications in wholebody N metabolism under the conditions of intestinal stress, liver disease, and kidney failure." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"Certain animal and insect species" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"harbor a pregastric microflora that produces indispensable amino acids (IAA) from simple and recycled nitrogenous compounds for the hosts (3)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"This advantage is not shared by humans and nonruminants, and the ability of distal small intestinal and colonic microbes to provide IAA is limited (3,4)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"enterocytes" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"This review highlights the demarcation between N metabolism in eukaryotic cells of the GIT (enterocytes and colonocytes) and microbial cells that grow in the lumen of the small intestine and large intestine (luminal microorganisms)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"In nonruminant animals and humans, the diet is the major source of N in the lumen of the small intestin" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"The N can be in the form of proteins, peptides, amino acids (AA), urea, ammonia, and other nitrogenous substances (including glutathione, polyamines, purines, pyrimidines, nitrite, nitrate, uric acid, and nitrosylated products)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"Except for neonates in which nearly all of protein-bound AA in milk are absorbed by the small intestine (7), the true ileal digestibility values for AA in plant and animal protein-based diets are 80-90% in pigs (8), resulting in the entry of undigested protein into the large intestine (colon)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"Free AA and small peptides are degraded by both enterocytes and luminal bacteria." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"Glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate in the lumen, as well as glutamine from the mesenteric artery circulation, are extensively oxidized by enterocytes of the porcine small intestine to generate ammonia, CO2, alanine, proline, citrulline, and arginine (9)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"A new aspect of AA nutrition is the finding that 30-50% of essential AA in the diet may be degraded by the small intestine during the initial phase of protein digestion and AA absorption or first-pass AA metabolism (12) (Fig. 1)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=1) )

"Thus, the extensive in vivo catabolism (first pass) of these indispensable AA by the pig small intestine (13,14) may result in part from the action of luminal microbes (15)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=2) )

"The ammonia and other nitrogenous products generated from intestinal (combined enterocyte and microbial) AA catabolism may enter the portal vein, lumen of the small intestine, or synthetic/degradative pathways in enterocytes (Fig. 1)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=2) )

"The endogenous sources of N in the lumen of the small intestine include saliva, gastric secretions, sloughed cells, and cell debris originating from the stomach and intestinal epithelium, bile, small intestinal secretions, pancreatic secretions, mucus, microorganisms, and mesenteric arterial blood (15). There are also secretions from the circulation (urea, ammonia) into the small and upper large intestine" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=2) )

"Studies with pigs and humans indicate that 20-25% of the urea synthesized in the liver enters, via circulation, the lumen of the intestine (primarily the small intestine), where urea is hydrolyzed by microbial urease into ammonia and CO2 (Fig. 1) (19)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=2) )

"Urea resynthesis in enterocytes helps to explain the apparent discrepancy in urea recycling between isotope dilution and mass balance studies (15)" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"Unfortunately, the composition of putative salvage N was not assessed and the potential of enterocyte ammonia utilization for dispensable AA and urea synthesis was not considered in the interpretation of the isotopomer data (10,11,15,20)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"Among the endogenous AA in the terminal ileum, the arginine family of AA (proline, glutamate plus glutamine, aspartate plus asparagine, and arginine) are the most abundant, followed by: 1) serine and glycine; 2) BCAA; and 3) other AA (15)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"Ammonia fixation initially involves glutamate dehydrogenase to generate glutamate, which reacts with another ammonia molecule to form glutamine by glutamine synthetase. These 2 enzymes are abundant in bacteria but have low activities in intestinal mucosal cells" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"Evidence shows that the colonic epithelium is not a source of digestive enzymes and that protein/peptide hydrolyses in the colon are a principal function of the microorganism (22)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the most widely used probiotic bacteria for maintaining the intestinal ecosystem and integrity." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"The possible underlying mechanisms may include enhancements of the release of digestive proteases from the GIT and pancreas and the absorption of small peptides and AA into enterocytes." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"The possible reasons for these divergent results may include differences in 1) animals (e.g.individual variations, developmental stage, basal growth rate, enteric pathogenic challenges, health status, intestinal microbial populations and numbers, intestinal fermentation products, and interactions of probiotics with the intestinal immune system and mucosa); 2) the probiotic products used (e.g. sources, strains, quality, shelf lives, and doses); 3) experimental diets (e.g. nutrient composition and balance, feeding frequency, palatability, the amount of feed consumption, presence of antinutritive factors, and water quality); and 4) environmental factors (sources and levels of stress, housing facilities, temperature, humidity, cleanliness, and management skills)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"Similarly, Estrada et al. (32) reported a beneficial effect of Bifidobacterium on pig growth performance. Second, early oral administration of probiotics (B. animalis and L. acidophilus, casei, pentosus, and plantarum) to formula-fed preterm infants increased intestinal growth, villus height, brush border and aminopeptidase A and N activities, altered the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota, ameliorated the mucosal atrophy and dysfunction, and reduced the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (33)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"Recent proteomics studies showed that the interactions between probiotics and the small intestine affected protein profiles." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"key enzymes involved in the microbe's energy metabolism decreased, including lactate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoamide" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=3) )

"dehydrogenase, and nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase and in AA metabolism, including arginyl-tRNA synthetase and aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, while increasing glycoside hydrolase (an enzyme for mucin degradation) and fructose- 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway) (38). In response to an interaction with L. fermentum I5007, intestinal cells exhibited changes in proteins related to nutrient transport and antioxidative capacity that were beneficial for gut integrity, including voltage-dependent anion channel 1, glutathione transferase, and heat shock protein gp96 (38). These proteins serve as useful biomarkers for metabolic changes in Lactobacillus and intestinal epithelial cells in response to their interactions." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=4) )

"Oligosaccharides (mainly fructooligosaccharides and mannanoligosaccharide) are commonly used probiotics for livestock species, poultry, and human" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=4) )

"A salient effect of prebiotics is their ability to: 1) improve the digestibility of nutrients (protein, dry matter, and minerals), absorption of AA by the small intestine, N economy in the intestine, and feed efficiency (39); 2) modulate the metabolism of urea, ammonia, and AA in the lumen of the large intestine (30); and 3) influence the intestinal microflora to selectively promote the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria (e.g. bifidobacteria) and therefore promote postnatal development of the intestinal and wholebody immune systems (40)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=4) )

"Moreover, COS supplementation improved the immune status in chickens and weanling pigs, as well as expression of genes in the small intestinal mucosa (44)." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=4) )

"Further, a mixture of neutral short-chain galactooligosaccharides and long-chain fructooligosaccharides reduced the incidence of atopic dermatitis, infection episodes, and allergic manifestations in infants." ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=4) )

"Finally, protective effects of prebiotics appear to persist beyond the intervention period primarily through modification of the intestinal flora (46). Utilization of the distal gut microbiota as a scavenger (and bowel elimination) for potentially pathogenic nitrogenous constituents in the digesta also has merit, but our understanding and ability to manipulate colonic fermentations for such purposes must clearly be extended to integrate these ideas into patient care" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=4) )

"To what degree modulation of AA metabolism in enterocytes and intestinal microbes may lower the ammonia and urea load to such patients is not well understood (48) and warrants further investigatio" ([Link](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q4CXM3QY?page=4) )
