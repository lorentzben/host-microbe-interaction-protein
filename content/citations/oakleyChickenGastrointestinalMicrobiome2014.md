### Abstract
The domestic chicken is a common model organism for human biological research and of course also forms the basis of a global protein industry. Recent methodological advances have spurred the recognition of microbiomes as complex communities with important influences on the health and disease status of the host. In this minireview, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of the chicken gastrointestinal microbiome focusing on spatial and temporal variability, the presence and importance of human pathogens, the influence of the microbiota on the immune system, and the importance of the microbiome for poultry nutrition. Review and meta-analysis of public data showed cecal communities dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroides at the phylum level, while at finer levels of taxonomic resolution, a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of microorganisms appears to have similar metabolic functions that provide important benefits to the host as inferred from metagenomic data. This observation of functional redundancy may have important implications for management of the microbiome. We foresee advances in strategies to improve gut health in commercial operations through management of the intestinal microbiota as an alternative to in-feed subtherapeutic antibiotics, improvements in pre- and probiotics, improved management of polymicrobial poultry diseases, and better control of human pathogens via colonization reduction or competitive exclusion strategies.In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of the chicken gastrointestinal microbiome focusing on spatial and temporal variability, the presence and importance of human pathogens, the influence of the microbiota on the immune system, and the importance of the microbiome for poultry nutrition.In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of the chicken gastrointestinal microbiome focusing on spatial and temporal variability, the presence and importance of human pathogens, the influence of the microbiota on the immune system, and the importance of the microbiome for poultry nutrition.

"First, direct sequencing of 16S rRNA genes has provided a powerful method to profile complex microbial communities without relying on cultivation. Second, in tandem with 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic census data, metagenomics has begun to fulfill early expectations of revolutionizing our understanding of microbial communities (NRC Committee on Metagenomics, 2007)."

"Lactobacilli also dominate the proventriculus, a thick-walled stomach, and the ventriculus (gizzard). The gizzard has been described as the 'teeth' of the gastrointestinal tract where a majority of mechanical and chemical breakdown of feed is performed (Ensminger, 1971; Rehman et al., 2007); the low pH of gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and pepsin limits the total number of cells below 108 g1 (Yeoman et al., 2012)" ([Oakley et al 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=2))

<a id="^028138"></a>"Here, we focus on the ceca as organs of particular interest as they harbor the highest microbial cell densities (up to 1011 cells g1), have the longest residence time (12-20 h) of digesta in the gastrointestinal tract, and are important sites for recycling of urea, water regulation, and carbohydrate fermentations contributing to intestinal health and nutrition (Ensminger, 1971; Clench & Mathias, 1995; Sergeant et al., 2014; Waite & Taylor, 2014)" ([Oakley et al 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=2)) ^028138

<a id="^3ffd99"></a>"Although chickens can survive with experimentally removed ceca (Clench & Mathias, 1995), around 10% of energy may be provided by digestive processes in the ceca where short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations are higher than elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract (Jozefiak et al., 2004)."

"facilitating direct comparisons across multiple studies," ([Oakley et al 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=2))

"Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Proteobacteria are the most common phyla in the chicken ceca, with Actinobacteria accounting for the remainder (Fig. 1a)" ([Oakley et al 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=2))

"the majority of sequence types can be shown to belong to various members of the Clostridiales (Fig. 1b)" ([Oakley et al 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=2))

"Although relatively few studies to date have examined the metabolic capabilities of the chicken cecal microbiome" ([Oakley et al 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=2))

"via metagenomics, some valuable insights have already been obtained." ([Oakley et al 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3))

"As might be inferred from the taxonomic composition of the cecal microbiome, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism are consistently abundantly represented in metagenomic libraries (Qu et al., 2008; Danzeisen et al., 2011; Sergeant et al., 2014)" ([Oakley et al 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3))

"Of particular interest is a recent study in which over 200 different nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) degrading enzymes were found, including a potentially novel pathway for propionate production (Sergeant et al., 2014)." ([Oakley et al 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3))

"Additionally, the discovery of uptake hydrogenases from some of the most abundant genera (Megamonas, Helicobacter, and Campylobacter) supports interesting speculations regarding a possible mechanism by which SCFA production is promoted by these taxa acting as hydrogen sinks (Sergeant et al., 2014)." ([Oakley et al 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3)) ^e08c18

"Similar patterns in chickens might suggest similar mechanisms governing community assembly, structure, function, and host selection." ([Oakley et al 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3))

"To test this, we performed a meta-analysis of public data from previous observations in chickens (Qu et al., 2008; Danzeisen et al., 2011)" ([Oakley et al 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3))

"This observation provides support for inferences made from human microbiome data to the chicken microbiome and has important implications for management of the microbiome as similar metabolic functions appear to be carried out by a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of microorganisms." ([Oakley et al 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3))

"In a metagenomic study of the chicken cecal microbiome, Qu et al. (2008) found that c. onefourth of assembled contigs were most closely related to transposes, suggesting that lateral gene transfer might be an important mechanism contributing to a 'pan-genome' under selective pressure for functional traits shared by multiple taxa." ([Oakley et al 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3))

"In most commercial poultry operations in the United States, a diverse microbial community in the housing environment (mainly in the litter) is carried over from one flock to the next and thus can serve as an important inoculum for the chick gastrointestinal microbiome (Liljebjelke et al., 2003)." ([Oakley et al 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=3))

"This possibility is supported by re-analysis of data from a recent paper (Oakley et al., 2013) to show c. 50 bacterial genera common to litter, fecal, and carcass samples from two flocks followed longitudinally from 'farm to fork' (Table 1). The presence of several putative pathogens (Table 1) may have important implications for this management practice (Pedroso et al., 2013)." ([Oakley et al 2014:103](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=4))

"Through the life span of a commercial broiler (typically 42 days), significant changes in the taxonomic composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome have been observed (Lu et al., 2003) and are well reviewed elsewhere (Rehman et al., 2007; Yeoman et al., 2012; Stanley et al., 2014)." ([Oakley et al 2014:103](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=4))

"Interestingly, variability is much higher for fecal vs. cecal samples (Fig. 3b vs. 3a), supporting previous suggestions (Stanley et al., 2014) that fecal samples may not be properly representative of the gastrointestinal tract due to differential mixing effects and the less frequent voiding of the ceca compared to the rest" ([Oakley et al 2014:103](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=4))

"of the gastrointestinal tract." ([Oakley et al 2014:103](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=4))

"The chicken intestinal microbiome commonly contains several taxa capable of causing significant illnesses in humans, most importantly Campylobacter and Salmonella. Campylobacter spp. (mostly C. jejuni and C. coli) are present in nearly all birds at up to 107 CFU g1 in the chicken intestine (Stern et al., 1995) and cultivable by week three from the poultry environment (Lee & Newell, 2006)" ([Oakley et al 2014:103](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=4))

"Escherichia coli is anotherc-proteobacteria present in the chicken intestine at low abundance throughout the life of the animal. Some E. coli strains are capable of causing opportunistic secondary infections in birds following other respiratory tract pathogens such as infectious bronchitis virus or Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Smith et al., 1985; Gross, 1990) in response to high ammonia levels in poultry houses, or physiological changes in its avian host such as egg peritonitis or salpingitis in response to egg laying (Landman et al., 2013)."

"The clostridial population includes some species pathogenic for poultry such as Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum, and C. colinum (Calnek, 1997). C. perfringens causes necrotic enteritis in poultry and isolates pathogenic for poultry contain a novel toxin type that is not possessed by human pathotypes (Keyburn et al., 2010). Antibiotic feed supplements such as avoparcin, bacitracin, or virginiamycin are often used to prevent necrotic enteritis, and these antibiotics significantly affect the community structure of the intestinal microbiome (Lee et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2006; Lee, 2008)." ([Oakley et al 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6))

"For example, diagnoses of dysbacteriosis refer to undefined shifts in the intestinal microbiota associated with visible changes in the thickness, appearance, muscle tone, and tensile strength of the intestinal wall." ([Oakley et al 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6))

"As an essential organ of the host mucosal immune system, the gut has evolved to carry out two apparently confounding tasks: nutrient absorption and pathogen defense." ([Oakley et al 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6))

"The intestinal immune system includes a robust mucosal layer, tightly interconnected intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), secreted soluble immunoglobulin A (IgA), and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). It is well established that a beneficial microbial community has an important role in maintaining normal physiological homeostasis, modulating host immune system, and influencing organ development and host metabolism (Sommer & Backhed, 2013)." ([Oakley et al 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6))

"Forder et al. (2007) described a differential mucin profile and a greater numbers of goblet cells in the intestine of conventionally reared broiler chicks relative to isolator-reared broiler chicks and concluded these dif-" ([Oakley et al 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6))

"ferences were due to differences in the microbiomes of the two groups." ([Oakley et al 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6))

"Over 40 years ago, Nurmi and Rantala introduced the term competitive exclusion (CE) describing reduced Salmonella colonization in birds orally gavaged as newly hatched chicks with intestinal contents from salmonellaefree birds (Nurmi & Rantala, 1973)." ([Oakley et al 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=6))

"Early observations that very low levels of Salmonella can colonize the intestinal tract of young broiler chicks, while older birds are resistant to infection led to the transfer of microbial communities from adults into dayold chicks which increased the resistance to salmonellae colonization as predicted (Pivnick & Nurmi, 1982; Cox et al., 1990)." ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"Similar introductions of complex microbial communities have been used to successfully treat gastrointestinal disorders including recurrent C. difficile infections in humans (Anderson et al., 2012; Lawley et al., 2012; Van Nood et al., 2013), although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood in all cases." ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"The majority of reported research shows that undefined mixtures from the intestinal tract of healthy adult birds are more effective in preventing Salmonella colonization than the defined mixtures that have been marketed" ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"Gastrointestinal microorganisms can have negative effects on the host such as overstimulation of the immune system, enzymatic digestion of intestinal mucus, breakdown of bile, or production of harmful amino acid catabolites (Gaskins et al., 2002), but a 'healthy' microbiota is considered a net benefit to the chicken." ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"break down polysaccharides (Beckmann et al., 2006; Qu et al., 2008), and provide energy as amino acids and SCFA (van der Wielen et al., 2000; Dunkley et al., 2007)" ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"gastrointestinal microbial communities have been shown to exclude pathogenic taxa (Nurmi et al., 1992), promote beneficial development of the intestinal mucus layer, epithelial monolayer, and lamina propria (McCracken & Gaskins, 1999; Shakouri et al., 2009), break down polysaccharides (Beckmann et al., 2006; Qu et al., 2008), and provide energy as amino acids and SCFA (van der Wielen et al., 2000; Dunkley et al., 2007" ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"SCFA are important nutrients for the host and are known to stimulate increases in absorptive surface area (Dibner & Richards, 2005). SCFA also reduce colonic pH, which can inhibit bile catabolism and subsequent conversion to secondary bile acids (Christl et al., 1997)." ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"the intestinal microbiota can also act as a complementary exogenous source. Members of the gut microbiota are able to synthesize vitamin K as well as most of the water-soluble B vitamins, such as biotin, cobalamin, folates, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, and thiamine (Ichihashi et al., 1992)" ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"Several studies have shown that growth performance, feed efficiency, and gut health in broiler chickens can be improved by dietary prebiotics, nondigestible carbohydrates selectively stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria (Xu et al., 2003; Yusrizal & Chen, 2003; Yang et al., 2008a b)." ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"For example, feed supplementation with 0.4% fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) in broiler chickens significantly increased body weight gain, feed efficiency, the activities of protease and amylase, ileal villus height, and the growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (Xu et al., 2003)" ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"Probiotics appear to be most effective during the initial development of the microbiota, or after any dietary change or stress and following antibiotic therapy and thus can be interpreted in the context of the ecological phenomena of primary and secondary succession in which a community is established or re-established following a disturbance" ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"Several studies have demonstrated that supplementing feed with probiotics containing Lactobacillus cultures can enhance body weight gain and feed efficiency and reduce mortality rate in broilers (Zulkifli et al., 2000; Kalavathy et al., 2003; Timmerman et al., 2006)" ([Oakley et al 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=7))

"example, a mixture of 12 Lactobacillus strains reduced abdominal fat deposition, serum total cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides in broilers (Jin et al., 1998)." ([Oakley et al 2014:107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=8))

"In mice and humans, Firmicutes have been shown to have a positive relationship with the ability to harvest energy from the diet (Turnbaugh et al., 2006, 2008; Jumpertz et al., 2011), and the Firmicutes : Bacteroides ratio may also be important for optimum physiology and nutrition (Mariat et al., 2009; De Filippo et al., 2010; Bervoets et al., 2013)." ([Oakley et al 2014:107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=8))

"An increase in fecal Firmicutes was associated with an increase in nutrient absorption, whereas an increase in fecal Bacteroidetes was associated with a decrease in nutrient absorption (Jumpertz et al., 2011)." ([Oakley et al 2014:107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DCIPX6EN?page=8))

"In a search for probiotic strains related to chicken performance, Torok et al. (2011) identified sequences related to Lactobacillus salivarius, L. aviarius, L. crispatus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, E. coli, Gallibacterium anatis, Clostridium lactatifermentans, Ruminococcus torques, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Alistipes finegoldii from ileal and cecal samples. In the lowest portion of the small intestine, Lactobacillus spp. have been implicated as a causal factor in low performance (DeLange & Wijtten, 2010), suggesting the location of colonization by probiotic strains may affect performance. As methodological advancements continue, we envision continued progress toward the development of novel probiotic approaches."
