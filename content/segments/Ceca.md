["In one example, metabolomics was employed to understand the caecum microbiome-host interaction during Salmonella infection in young layers (Mon et al., 2020)" ](/citations/dehauOmicsTechnologiesPoultry2022/)

### What was the result of this study? I know it is related to Salmonella but maybe is has impacts

[“overview of carbohydrate fermentation in the avian ceca as well as to focus on some potential advantages to the bird of this fermentation.” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 1)](/citations/jozefiakCarbohydrateFermentationAvian2004/)

### Some fermentation occurs in the ceca this includes the Non starch polysaccharides 

[“NSPs can be hydrolyzed by enzymes produced by the cecal microflora or by supplementation of poultry diets with specific feed enzymes (Choct et al., 1999; Jamroz et al., 2002).” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2) ](/citations/jozefiakCarbohydrateFermentationAvian2004/)

### Short Chain Fatty Acids in Ceca

^79caee

["Although chickens can survive with experimentally removed ceca (Clench & Mathias, 1995), around 10% of energy may be provided by digestive processes in the ceca where short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations are higher than elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract (Jozefiak et al., 2004)."](/citations/oakleyChickenGastrointestinalMicrobiome2014#^3ffd99)

Megamonas, Helicobacter, and Campylobacter are curious taxa that may be acting as "hydrogen sinks" and producing these SCFAs which [oakley meantioned](/citations/oakleyChickenGastrointestinalMicrobiome2014#^e08c18)

### Some of the roles of the ceca

[“Ceca in chickens are two blind sacs that mark the joint point between the small and the large intestine. In these segments, materials of ileal and renal origin are subjected to long retention times, enabling for most of the electrolytes and water absorption 36. Moreover, the ceca are an important site for the fermentation of any residual raw material with the consequent production of SCFA and B-group vitamins. Ceca empty their content two to three times per day, producing cecal droppings, whose color and texture are used to evaluate the normal functionality of the chickenś digestive tract 36, 37.”](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^18c971)

[“Many researchers have speculated about the role of the avian ceca. There is evidence that the ceca play a role in the microbial degradation of some carbohydrates (Jorgensen et al., 1996; Jamroz et al., 2002), absorption of water (McNab, 1973), microbial synthesis of vitamins (Coates et al., 1968), cholesterol digestion and absorption (Tortuero et al., 1975)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2)](/citations/jozefiakCarbohydrateFermentationAvian2004/)

[“Van der Wielen et al. (2000) demonstrated that high fermentation activity in chicken ceca was correlated with a lower pH” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11)](/citations/jozefiakCarbohydrateFermentationAvian2004/)

["Here, we focus on the ceca as organs of particular interest as they harbor the highest microbial cell densities (up to 1011 cells g1), have the longest residence time (12-20 h) of digesta in the gastrointestinal tract, and are important sites for recycling of urea, water regulation, and carbohydrate fermentations contributing to intestinal health and nutrition (Ensminger, 1971; Clench & Mathias, 1995; Sergeant et al., 2014; Waite & Taylor, 2014)"](/citations/oakleyChickenGastrointestinalMicrobiome2014#^028138)

### Who is present in the ceca?

### Firmicutes and Bacteroides

["cecal communities dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroides at the phylum level, while at finer levels of taxonomic resolution, a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of microorganisms appears to have similar metabolic functions that provide important benefits to the host as inferred from metagenomic data."](/citations/oakleyChickenGastrointestinalMicrobiome2014#^591b5e)

["Caecal bacterial taxa such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus genus, Lachnospiraceae family and Bacteroides genus, are associated with good bird performance or low feed conversion ratio (FCR) (Stanley et al., 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016; Singh et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2018)."](/citations/dehauomicstechnologiespoultry2022/#^f77bd9)

### Are these the only taxa or can we identify even more?

["Ceca is the most colonized section and is featured by a very high bacterial diversity. Here, the most abundant bacterial specimens are Clostridiaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Lactobacillus spp., Proteobacteria, and unknown Firmicutes"](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^52c1e4)
