["Caecal bacterial taxa such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus genus, Lachnospiraceae family and Bacteroides genus, are associated with good bird performance or low feed conversion ratio (FCR) (Stanley et al., 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016; Singh et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2018)."](citations/dehauomicstechnologiespoultry2022/)
Are these the only taxa or can we identify even more?

["In one example, metabolomics was employed to understand the caecum microbiome-host interaction during Salmonella infection in young layers (Mon et al., 2020)" ](citations/dehauOmicsTechnologiesPoultry2022/)

What was the result of this study? I know it is related to Salmonella but maybe is has impacts

Some fermentation occurs in the ceca this includes the Non starch polysaccharides 

[“NSPs can be hydrolyzed by enzymes produced by the cecal microflora or by supplementation of poultry diets with specific feed enzymes (Choct et al., 1999; Jamroz et al., 2002).” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2) ](citations/jozefiakCarbohydrateFermentationAvian2004/)

Some of the roles of the ceca
[“Many researchers have speculated about the role of the avian ceca. There is evidence that the ceca play a role in the microbial degradation of some carbohydrates (Jorgensen et al., 1996; Jamroz et al., 2002), absorption of water (McNab, 1973), microbial synthesis of vitamins (Coates et al., 1968), cholesterol digestion and absorption (Tortuero et al., 1975)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 2)](citations/jozefiakCarbohydrateFermentationAvian2004/)

[“Van der Wielen et al. (2000) demonstrated that high fermentation activity in chicken ceca was correlated with a lower pH” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11)](citations/jozefiakCarbohydrateFermentationAvian2004/)
