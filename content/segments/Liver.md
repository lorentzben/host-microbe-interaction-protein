["Catabolism of amino acids occurs in the liver, which contains the urea cycle (26), however the rate of conversion of amino acid derived ammonia to urea is limited"](/citations/bilsboroughReviewIssuesDietary2006)

Inside the liver the urea cycle occurs as well as the breakdown of amino acids to ammonia and eventually to urea and uric acid. 

["The advantage of oxidizing most amino acids in the liver to glucose is that only the liver need expend the energy needed to synthesize the entire complex array of enzymes involved in amino acid oxidation"](/citations/bilsboroughReviewIssuesDietary2006)

Again catabolism of AA in the liver 

["Six members of the trypsinogen gene family have been characterized in the chicken (Wang et al., 1995)," These are expressed in the pancreas along with the liver, spleen, and thymus (Wang et al., 1995)."](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021)

Low activity of Glutaminase since glutimate is used for Uric Acid Production

["Glutamine is critically important for uric acid formation (see the Section 20.4.2.3). It is not surprising that glutaminase (catalyzing glutamine to glutamate) is either not present or at very low levels in the avian liver (chicken: Wu et al., 1998)."](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021)

["The primary ammonia-detoxifying enzyme in the avian liver is glutamine synthase."](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021)

["Glutamine is a significant energy source for at least some tissues in birds. For instance, it is the major energy source for avian erythrocytes"](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021)
