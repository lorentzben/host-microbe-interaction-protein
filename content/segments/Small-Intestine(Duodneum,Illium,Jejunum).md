["Most protein digestion occurs in the initial of small intestine, in the duodenum and jejunum, by proteolytic enzymes from pancreatic secretion."](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016/)

this is also confirmed by Scanes in Sturkies

["20.2 DIGESTION OF PROTEINS Proteins are digested in the gastrointestinal tract to amino acids and dipeptides together with tripeptides. The predominant site for protein digestion is the small intestine. The amino acids and peptides are absorbed in the small intestine."](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)
[“The predominant site of protein digestion is the small intestine (Table 20.3). The digested protein (amino acids and dipeptides together with tripeptides) is absorbed in the small intestine (Table 20.3).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)


[“Chymotrypsinogen is activated in the small intestine by proteolytic cleavage, for instance by trypsin.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) ](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)

["trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypolypeptidase and proelastase. The trypsin and chymotrypsin split protein molecules into small polypeptides; carboxy polypeptidase then cleaves individual amino acids from the carboxyl ends of the polypeptides. Proelastase, in turn, is converted into elastase, which then digests elastin fibers that partially hold meats together."](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016/)

[“Amino acids are absorbed in the small intestine (chicken jejunum and ileum: Tasaki and Takahashi, 1966).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)

[“Methionine is absorbed at the highest rate, followed by isoleucine, valine, and leucine, and glutamate is absorbed at the lowest rate, followed by aspartate, glycine, and arginine (Tasaki and Takahashi, 1966; Riley et al., 1986)” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/) ^73b552

[“There are series of amino acid transporters (10 in chickens) expressed in the enterocytes of the small intestine, with predominantly increases progressing down the small intestine from the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (chickens: Gilbert et al., 2007).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)
[“Moreover, there are increases in the expression of many amino acid transporters during the period of growth and development post hatching (chickens: Gilbert et al., 2007).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) ](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)

In the Attwter Prarie Chicken certain taxa were identified :

["Micrococcaceae (29.8 %), Planococcaceae (7.2 %), Pseudomonadaceae (7.2 %), Enterobacteriaceae (5.4 %), and Erysipelotrichaceae (4.2 %)."](/citations/zhangSpatialMicrobialComposition2017/)
["Micrococcaceae was the most dominant bacterial family in half of the ileum (4/8), large intestine (4/8), and cloaca (5/8) samples. The microbial communities in the cecum were dominated by five to seven relatively high abundant (5.5-37.8 %) families including Enterobacteriaceae (13.9 % ± 13.4 %), Ruminococcaceae (12.9 % ± 7.6 %), Lachnospiraceae (10.6 % ± 4.5 %), Coriobacteriaceae (7.2 % ± 4.7 %), and Erysipelotrichaceae (3.9 % ± 6.2 %)."](/citations/zhangSpatialMicrobialComposition2017/)

In mammals specifically, but theres a good chance this holds in poultry.

["Microbial densities in the proximal and middle small intestine are relatively low but increase dramatically in the distal small intestine (approximately 108 bacteria/ml of luminal contents) and colon (10u-1012/g) (90)."](/citations/hooperHowHostmicrobialInteractions2002#^42e6d0)

## Duodenum

[“The small intestine is further divided into three main sections. Duodenum represents the first section; here, the acidic secretion from the upper gastrointestinal tract are mixed with the bile and pancreatic juices, leading to a sudden alkylation of the environment that marks the beginning of the digestive processes.” (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^30862d)

[“Due to the low pH, pancreatic and bile secretions, the bacterial density in the duodenum is comparably low” (Tilocca, 2019, p. 55)](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^516e29) 

#### Taxa
[“Duodenal microbiota is almost exclusively composed of Lactobacillus spp. (up to 99% of the total diversity), but Streptococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae may also be abundantly identified 40.” (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^605b56)


## Jejunum

[“Jejunal segment extends from the duodenal loop until the Meckel's diverticulum. Main feature of this section is represented by its large size, enabling the digestion and adsorption of the major nutrients, despite a reduced retention time of 40-60 minutes 32-34.”](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^092ed5)

### Taxa

[“Besides Lactobacillus as the main colonizer of the jejunum (reaching coverage of up to 99%), Streptococcus was identified as well.” (Tilocca, 2019, p. 55) ](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^26e0b1)

## Ileum

[“Ileum is the third segment of the small intestine, it ends at ileo-cecal junction and plays a pivotal role in the absorption of water and minerals. Only a minor activity has been observed in digestion and absorption of fat, carbohydrates and proteins 35"](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^05b7af)

[“Lu et al. demonstrated that during all different stages of microbial community development in the ileum Lactobacilli were dominant [26]. This gut section is also known to be colonized by novel butyrate producing bacteria that may play an important role regarding the availability of nutrients, absorption rate and chicken performance"](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^9139ef)

#### Taxa 

[“Despite being dominated by Lactobacillus spp., the ileum is considered as a source of novel bacteria, including butyrate-producing species and other novel bacteria involved in nutrient availability and absorption; Clostridium spp., Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus” (Tilocca, 2019, p. 16)](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^d0a591)

[“The chicken's ileum harbors Lactobacillus in higher abundance (&gt; 68%) and in lower abundances Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae"](/citations/tiloccaEffectsDietsDifferent2019#^0dd086)
