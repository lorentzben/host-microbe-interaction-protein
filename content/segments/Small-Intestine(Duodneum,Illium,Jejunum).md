["Most protein digestion occurs in the initial of small intestine, in the duodenum and jejunum, by proteolytic enzymes from pancreatic secretion."](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016/)

this is also confirmed by Scanes in Sturkies

["20.2 DIGESTION OF PROTEINS Proteins are digested in the gastrointestinal tract to amino acids and dipeptides together with tripeptides. The predominant site for protein digestion is the small intestine. The amino acids and peptides are absorbed in the small intestine."](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)
[“The predominant site of protein digestion is the small intestine (Table 20.3). The digested protein (amino acids and dipeptides together with tripeptides) is absorbed in the small intestine (Table 20.3).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)


[“Chymotrypsinogen is activated in the small intestine by proteolytic cleavage, for instance by trypsin.” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) ](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)

["trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypolypeptidase and proelastase. The trypsin and chymotrypsin split protein molecules into small polypeptides; carboxy polypeptidase then cleaves individual amino acids from the carboxyl ends of the polypeptides. Proelastase, in turn, is converted into elastase, which then digests elastin fibers that partially hold meats together."](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016/)

[“Amino acids are absorbed in the small intestine (chicken jejunum and ileum: Tasaki and Takahashi, 1966).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)

[“Methionine is absorbed at the highest rate, followed by isoleucine, valine, and leucine, and glutamate is absorbed at the lowest rate, followed by aspartate, glycine, and arginine (Tasaki and Takahashi, 1966; Riley et al., 1986)” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/) ^73b552

[“There are series of amino acid transporters (10 in chickens) expressed in the enterocytes of the small intestine, with predominantly increases progressing down the small intestine from the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (chickens: Gilbert et al., 2007).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457)](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)
[“Moreover, there are increases in the expression of many amino acid transporters during the period of growth and development post hatching (chickens: Gilbert et al., 2007).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 457) ](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)

In the Attwter Prarie Chicken certain taxa were identified :

["Micrococcaceae (29.8 %), Planococcaceae (7.2 %), Pseudomonadaceae (7.2 %), Enterobacteriaceae (5.4 %), and Erysipelotrichaceae (4.2 %)."](/citations/zhangSpatialMicrobialComposition2017/)
["Micrococcaceae was the most dominant bacterial family in half of the ileum (4/8), large intestine (4/8), and cloaca (5/8) samples. The microbial communities in the cecum were dominated by five to seven relatively high abundant (5.5-37.8 %) families including Enterobacteriaceae (13.9 % ± 13.4 %), Ruminococcaceae (12.9 % ± 7.6 %), Lachnospiraceae (10.6 % ± 4.5 %), Coriobacteriaceae (7.2 % ± 4.7 %), and Erysipelotrichaceae (3.9 % ± 6.2 %)."](/citations/zhangSpatialMicrobialComposition2017/)

In mammals specifically, but theres a good chance this holds in poultry.

["Microbial densities in the proximal and middle small intestine are relatively low but increase dramatically in the distal small intestine (approximately 108 bacteria/ml of luminal contents) and colon (10u-1012/g) (90)."](/citations/hooperHowHostmicrobialInteractions2002#^42e6d0)
