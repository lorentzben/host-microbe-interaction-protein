Enzymes active in Stomach

Pepsin 
["Pepsin, an important peptic enzyme of the stomach, is most active at a pH of 2.0 to 3.0."](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016/)

["it reaches the stomach, where it is acted on by gastric juice in a very acidic environment. Gastric juice contains a family of aspartic proteinases called pepsins. Pepsins digested the protein into a mixture of polypeptides and move down to the duodenum. As the protein enters the duodenum, the pH rises to about 6.0 to 8.0. This pH change approximately from 2.0 to 8.0 can also cause precipitation of the protein through its iso-electric point and then may not easily re-dissolve."](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016/)
