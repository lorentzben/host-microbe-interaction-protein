[Proteolytic Enzymes](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016#^57cee2) - Enzymes that break long chain protiens into smaller peptides. Two major groups exo/endo-peptidases; "aspartic endopeptidases, [cysteine](https://www.britannica.com/science/cysteine) endopeptidases, glutamic endopeptidases, metalloendopeptidases, [serine](https://www.britannica.com/science/serine) endopeptidases, and [threonine](https://www.britannica.com/science/threonine) endopeptidases. The term _oligopeptidase_ is reserved for those enzymes that act specifically on peptides." [source Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/science/proteolytic-enzyme)

[Alimentary system](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016#^c7b2fd/) - The human digestive system [source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_digestive_system)

[Enterocytes](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016#^6d18ed) - Cells that line the inner surface of small and large intestines. One function is "**Peptide and amino acid uptake**. Peptidases in the glycocalyx cleave proteins to amino acids or small peptides. [Enteropeptidase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteropeptidase "Enteropeptidase") (also known as enterokinase) is responsible for activating [pancreatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic "Pancreatic") [trypsinogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypsinogen "Trypsinogen") into [trypsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypsin "Trypsin"), which activates other pancreatic [zymogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zymogens "Zymogens"). They are involved in the [Krebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krebs_cycle "Krebs cycle") and the [Cori Cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_Cycle "Cori Cycle") and can be synthesized with [lipase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase "Lipase")."[source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocyte)

[Epithelial cells](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016#^9ddc7d) - "Columnar epithelial cells are elongated and column-shaped and have a height of at least four times their width. Their nuclei are elongated and are usually located near the base of the cells. Columnar epithelium forms the lining of the stomach and intestines. The cells here may possess [microvilli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microvilli "Microvilli") for maximizing the surface area for absorption, and these microvilli may form a [brush border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush_border "Brush border"). Other cells may be [ciliated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilia "Cilia") to move mucus in the function of [mucociliary clearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucociliary_clearance "Mucociliary clearance"). Other ciliated cells are found in the [fallopian tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tubes "Fallopian tubes"), the uterus and [central canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_canal "Central canal") of the [spinal cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord "Spinal cord"). Some columnar cells are specialized for sensory reception such as in the nose, ears and the [taste buds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_bud "Taste bud"). [Hair cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_cell "Hair cell") in the [inner ears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear "Inner ear") have [stereocilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereocilia_(inner_ear) "Stereocilia (inner ear)") which are similar to microvilli. [Goblet cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblet_cell "Goblet cell") are modified columnar cells and are found between the columnar epithelial cells of the duodenum. They secrete mucus, which acts as a lubricant. Single-layered non-ciliated columnar epithelium tends to indicate an absorptive function. Stratified columnar epithelium is rare but is found in [lobar ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)#Duct_system "Duct (anatomy)") in the [salivary glands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_glands "Salivary glands"), the [eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye "Eye"), the [pharynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharynx "Pharynx"), and [sex organs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organs "Sex organs"). This consists of a layer of cells resting on at least one other layer of epithelial cells, which can be squamous, cuboidal, or columnar." [source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium)

[Portal Venous System](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016#^9ddc7d)- where a capilary bed pools into another capillary bed through veins typically related to the hepatic portal vein which is the vein that connects to the liver [source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_venous_system)

[Lymphatic Lacteal](/citations/soleymani-goloujehSystematicReviewProteins2016#^9ddc7d)- Lympatic capilary that absorbs dietary fats in the villi of the small intesting [source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacteal)
