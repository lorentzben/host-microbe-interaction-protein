["SCFA are important nutrients for the host and are known to stimulate increases in absorptive surface area (Dibner & Richards, 2005). SCFA also reduce colonic pH, which can inhibit bile catabolism and subsequent conversion to secondary bile acids (Christl et al., 1997)."](/citations/oakleyChickenGastrointestinalMicrobiome2014#^06a35d)

["Pathways for non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) utilization, SCFA production and hydrogen consumption were identified (Sergeant et al., 2014"](/citations/2022-11-07-dehauomicstechnologiespoultry2022/index#^029aa3)

["Of particular interest is a recent study in which over 200 different nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) degrading enzymes were found, including a potentially novel pathway for propionate production (Sergeant et al., 2014)." "Additionally, the discovery of uptake hydrogenases from some of the most abundant genera (Megamonas, Helicobacter, and Campylobacter) supports interesting speculations regarding a possible mechanism by which SCFA production is promoted by these taxa acting as hydrogen sinks (Sergeant et al., 2014)."](citations/oakleyChickenGastrointestinalMicrobiome2014#^e08c18)
