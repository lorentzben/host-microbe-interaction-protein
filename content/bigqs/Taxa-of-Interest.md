# Clostridium _prefingens_ (Species)

[“A previous study reported a higher number of Clostridium perfringens in ileum and cecum of broiler chickens raised on organic farms as compared to the conventional farms was observed (36)”](/citations/adhikariEffectsHousingTypes2020#^c1a3b2)

[“lower count of C. perfringens in conventional farms might be achieved due to the application of Salinomycin in the conventional feed that has antibiotic properties. In addition, they found an increase in Lactobacilli, while a decrease in Enterobacteriaceae counts in the ileal contents of the chickens from organic farms (36).”](/citations/adhikariEffectsHousingTypes2020#^cd2c3b)

# Bifidobacterium (Genus)

["enrichment of Bifidobacterium in both ileum and ceca of broiler chickens which were provided free daytime access to outdoor space as compared to those chickens which were kept at indoors range (37).”](/citations/adhikariEffectsHousingTypes2020#^50a298)

# Firmicutes (Phylum)

Higher levels of Firmicutes have been associated with higher levels of obesity and have been linked to higher [SCFA](/bigqs/roles-of-scfas) levels. [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6351938/) There is greater fermentation occuring in the colon producing these SCFAs. 

[“Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was higher in cecum of cage-raised chickens, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was higher in free-range chickens (38).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 13) ](/citations/adhikariEffectsHousingTypes2020#^48a006) 



# Bacteroidetes (Phylum)

[“we also reported the higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in EC where hens have more flexibility in movement and behavioral expression, while the higher abundance of Firmicutes in CC where they have restricted movement, especially at 67 weeks of age. In addition, we also reported significantly higher abundance of Proteobacteria in EC at 72 weeks of age in CC and EC.”](/citations/adhikariEffectsHousingTypes2020#^c45302)

[“Specifically, bifidobacteria are well-known for their ability to ferment complex carbohydrates in the lower part of the intestine that bypasses the degradation in the upper parts through various carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (43). They can ferment diverse complex carbon sources including gastric mucin, (trans)-galactooligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, malto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, pectin, soybean oligosaccharides, and other plant derived-oligosaccharides. However, their ability to degrade particular carbon source is species/strain-dependent (44). Through fermentation, bifidobacteria can degrade complex carbohydrates to monosaccharides which are further degraded to intermediates of the hexose fermentation pathway (also known as Bifidobacterium shunt or fructose-6-phosphate shunt) (45) and finally converted to short-chain fatty acids, especially acetate and lactate (42).” (Adhikari et al., 2020, p. 14) Make a note of this " ](/citations/adhikariEffectsHousingTypes2020#^e96f06)
