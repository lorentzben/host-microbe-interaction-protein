["This kind of causal model can be tested by transferring geneticor diet-modulated faecal microbiome from donors to receivers and assessing whether the corresponding phenotype was transmitted or not."](/citations/chenSystemBiologyPerspective2018/)

We can transfer a modulated microbiome and see if there was pheotypic changes?

Potential SCFA methodology:

[“In non-ruminants (e.g. pigs), SCFA are not metabolized in the stomach epithelia, so absorption may be measured by analyzing arterial and portal blood together with portal blood flow (Gäbel, 1995)” (Józefiak et al., 2004, p. 11) Potential research method](/citations/jozefiakCarbohydrateFermentationAvian2004/)

#TODO has this test been followed up on since 2004? ^837893

Whole Body Net Synthesis or Degradation of protein

[“It is also possible to experimentally determine whole-body protein net synthesis (accretion) or net degradation, and whole-body protein synthesis, using infusion of a radioactive form of a nonmetabolized amino acid such as phenyl alanine or tyrosine (see Table 20.4). As might be expected, net protein synthesis or accretion is negative in starved chicks or chicks on a diet deficient in specific amino acids (Table 20.5).” (Scanes, 2021, p. 458)](/citations/scanesProteinMetabolism2021/)
